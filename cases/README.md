These three .csv files record the real-world users' navigation issues collected from online Q&A forums and mailing lists for Apache httpd, MySQL, and Hadoop.
The original url, the original users' question, the keywords, and the target knob(s) is maintained for each issue.

These issues are used to evaluate the performance of Cox. In *benchmarks/data* directory, there are three corresponding files {apache,mysql,hadoop}_tc_icon.csv (only including the keywords and target knobs) that are the files inputted in benchmarking.
