AuthFormLogoutLocation

Description:  The URL to redirect to after a user has logged out 
Syntax:   AuthFormLogoutLocation  uri   
Default:   none  
Context:  directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_auth_form 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.3.0 and later. The use of the expression
parser hass been added in 2.4.4. 

 The   AuthFormLogoutLocation   directive
    specifies the URL of a page on the server to redirect to should the user attempt to log
    out. The value is parsed using the  ap_expr  parser before
    being sent to the client. 

     When a URI is accessed that is served by the handler  form-logout-handler ,
    the page specified by this directive will be shown to the end user. For example: 

      Example  < Location /logout >
    SetHandler form-logout-handler
    AuthFormLogoutLocation http://example.com/loggedout.html
    Session on
    #...
< /Location > 
 

     An attempt to access the URI  /logout/  will result in the user being logged
    out, and the page  /loggedout.html  will be displayed. Make sure that the page
     loggedout.html  is not password protected, otherwise the page will not be
    displayed.
