RewriteEngine

Description:  Enables or disables runtime rewriting engine 
Syntax:   RewriteEngine on|off  
Default:   RewriteEngine off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_rewrite 

 The  RewriteEngine  directive enables or
      disables the runtime rewriting engine. If it is set to
       off  this module does no runtime processing at
      all. It does not even update the  SCRIPT_URx 
      environment variables. 

       Use this directive to disable rules in a particular context,
      rather than commenting out all the   RewriteRule   directives. 

       Note that rewrite configurations are not
      inherited by virtual hosts. This means that you need to have a
       RewriteEngine on  directive for each virtual host
      in which you wish to use rewrite rules. 

        RewriteMap  directives of the type  prg 
      are not started during server initialization if they're defined in a
      context that does not have  RewriteEngine   set to
       on
