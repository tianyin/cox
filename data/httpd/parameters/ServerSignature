ServerSignature

Description:  Configures the footer on server-generated documents 
Syntax:   ServerSignature On|Off|EMail  
Default:   ServerSignature Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  All 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 The  ServerSignature  directive allows the
    configuration of a trailing footer line under server-generated
    documents (error messages,   mod_proxy   ftp directory
    listings,   mod_info   output, ...). The reason why you
    would want to enable such a footer line is that in a chain of proxies,
    the user often has no possibility to tell which of the chained servers
    actually produced a returned error message. 

     The  Off 
    setting, which is the default, suppresses the footer line (and is
    therefore compatible with the behavior of Apache-1.2 and
    below). The  On  setting simply adds a line with the
    server version number and   ServerName   of the serving virtual host,
    and the  EMail  setting additionally creates a
    "mailto:" reference to the   ServerAdmin   of the referenced
    document. 

     After version 2.0.44, the details of the server version number
    presented are controlled by the   ServerTokens   directive.
