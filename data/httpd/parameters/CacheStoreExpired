CacheStoreExpired

Description:  Attempt to cache responses that the server reports as expired 
Syntax:   CacheStoreExpired On|Off  
Default:   CacheStoreExpired Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache 

 Since httpd 2.2.4, responses which have already expired are not
       stored in the cache.  The  CacheStoreExpired 
       directive allows this behavior to be overridden.
        CacheStoreExpired  On
       tells the server to attempt to cache the resource if it is stale.
       Subsequent requests would trigger an If-Modified-Since request of
       the origin server, and the response may be fulfilled from cache
       if the backend resource has not changed.
