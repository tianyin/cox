<Limit>

Description:  Restrict enclosed access controls to only certain HTTP
methods 
Syntax:   < Limit  method  [ method ] ...  > ...
    < /Limit >  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig, Limit 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 Access controls are normally effective for
     all  access methods, and this is the usual
    desired behavior.  In the general case, access control
    directives should not be placed within a
     < Limit >  section.  

     The purpose of the  < Limit > 
    directive is to restrict the effect of the access controls to the
    nominated HTTP methods. For all other methods, the access
    restrictions that are enclosed in the  < Limit >  bracket  will have no
    effect . The following example applies the access control
    only to the methods  POST ,  PUT , and
     DELETE , leaving all other methods unprotected: 

     < Limit POST PUT DELETE >
  Require valid-user
< /Limit > 


     The method names listed can be one or more of:  GET ,
     POST ,  PUT ,  DELETE ,
     CONNECT ,  OPTIONS ,
     PATCH ,  PROPFIND ,  PROPPATCH ,
     MKCOL ,  COPY ,  MOVE ,
     LOCK , and  UNLOCK .  The method name is
    case-sensitive.  If  GET  is used it will also
    restrict  HEAD  requests. The  TRACE  method
    cannot be limited (see   TraceEnable  ). 

     A   < LimitExcept >   section should always be
    used in preference to a  < Limit > 
    section when restricting access, since a   < LimitExcept >   section provides protection
    against arbitrary methods. 

     The  < Limit >  and
      < LimitExcept >  
    directives may be nested.  In this case, each successive level of
     < Limit >  or   < LimitExcept >   directives must
    further restrict the set of methods to which access controls apply. 

     When using
     < Limit >  or
     < LimitExcept >  directives with
    the   Require   directive,
    note that the first   Require  
    to succeed authorizes the request, regardless of the presence of other
      Require   directives. 

     For example, given the following configuration, all users will
    be authorized for  POST  requests, and the
     Require group editors  directive will be ignored
    in all cases: 

     < LimitExcept GET >
  Require valid-user
< /LimitExcept >
< Limit POST >
  Require group editors
< /Limit >
