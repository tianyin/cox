UseCanonicalName

Description:  Configures how the server determines its own name and
port 
Syntax:   UseCanonicalName On|Off|DNS  
Default:   UseCanonicalName Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 In many situations Apache httpd must construct a  self-referential 
    URL -- that is, a URL that refers back to the same server. With
     UseCanonicalName On  Apache httpd will use the hostname and port
    specified in the   ServerName  
    directive to construct the canonical name for the server. This name
    is used in all self-referential URLs, and for the values of
     SERVER_NAME  and  SERVER_PORT  in CGIs. 

     With  UseCanonicalName Off  Apache httpd will form
    self-referential URLs using the hostname and port supplied by
    the client if any are supplied (otherwise it will use the
    canonical name, as defined above). These values are the same
    that are used to implement  name-based virtual hosts ,
    and are available with the same clients. The CGI variables
     SERVER_NAME  and  SERVER_PORT  will be
    constructed from the client supplied values as well. 

     An example where this may be useful is on an intranet server
    where you have users connecting to the machine using short
    names such as  www . You'll notice that if the users
    type a shortname, and a URL which is a directory, such as
     http://www/splat ,  without the trailing
    slash  then Apache httpd will redirect them to
     http://www.example.com/splat/ . If you have
    authentication enabled, this will cause the user to have to
    authenticate twice (once for  www  and once again
    for  www.example.com  -- see  
    the FAQ on this subject for more information ). But if
     UseCanonicalName  is set  Off , then
    Apache httpd will redirect to  http://www/splat/ . 

     There is a third option,  UseCanonicalName DNS ,
    which is intended for use with mass IP-based virtual hosting to
    support ancient clients that do not provide a
     Host:  header. With this option Apache httpd does a
    reverse DNS lookup on the server IP address that the client
    connected to in order to work out self-referential URLs. 

      Warning 
     If CGIs make assumptions about the values of  SERVER_NAME 
    they may be broken by this option. The client is essentially free
    to give whatever value they want as a hostname. But if the CGI is
    only using  SERVER_NAME  to construct self-referential URLs
    then it should be just fine.
