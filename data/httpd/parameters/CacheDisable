CacheDisable

Description:  Disable caching of specified URLs 
Syntax:   CacheDisable  url-string  |  on   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache 

 The  CacheDisable  directive instructs
      mod_cache   to  not  cache urls at or below
     url-string . 

      Example  CacheDisable /local_files 
 

     If used in a  < Location >  directive,
    the path needs to be specified below the Location, or if the word "on"
    is used, caching for the whole location will be disabled. 

      Example  < Location /foo >
    CacheDisable on
< /Location > 
 

     The  no-cache  environment variable can be set to
    disable caching on a finer grained set of resources in versions
    2.2.12 and later.
