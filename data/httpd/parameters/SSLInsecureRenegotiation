SSLInsecureRenegotiation

Description:  Option to enable support for insecure renegotiation 
Syntax:   SSLInsecureRenegotiation on|off  
Default:   SSLInsecureRenegotiation off  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 
Compatibility:  Available in httpd 2.2.15 and later, if using OpenSSL 0.9.8m or later 

 As originally specified, all versions of the SSL and TLS protocols
(up to and including TLS/1.2) were vulnerable to a Man-in-the-Middle
attack
( CVE-2009-3555 )
during a renegotiation.  This vulnerability allowed an attacker to
"prefix" a chosen plaintext to the HTTP request as seen by the web
server.  A protocol extension was developed which fixed this
vulnerability if supported by both client and server. 

 If   mod_ssl   is linked against OpenSSL version 0.9.8m
or later, by default renegotiation is only supported with
clients supporting the new protocol extension.  If this directive is
enabled, renegotiation will be allowed with old (unpatched) clients,
albeit insecurely. 

  Security warning 
 If this directive is enabled, SSL connections will be vulnerable to
the Man-in-the-Middle prefix attack as described
in  CVE-2009-3555 . 
 

  Example  SSLInsecureRenegotiation on 
 

 The  SSL_SECURE_RENEG  environment variable can be used
from an SSI or CGI script to determine whether secure renegotiation is
supported for a given SSL connection.
