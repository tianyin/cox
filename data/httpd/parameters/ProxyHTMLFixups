Description:  Fixes for simple HTML errors. 
Syntax:   ProxyHTMLFixups  [lowercase] [dospath] [reset]   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_proxy_html 
Compatibility:  Version 2.4 and later; available as a third-party
for earlier 2.x versions 

 This directive takes one to three arguments as follows: 
   lowercase  Urls are rewritten to lowercase 
  dospath  Backslashes in URLs are rewritten to forward slashes. 
  reset  Unset any options set at a higher level in the configuration. 
  Take care when using these.  The fixes will correct certain authoring
mistakes, but risk also erroneously fixing links that were correct to start with.
Only use them if you know you have a broken backend server.
