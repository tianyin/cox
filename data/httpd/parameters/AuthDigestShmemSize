AuthDigestShmemSize

Description:  The amount of shared memory to allocate for keeping track
of clients 
Syntax:   AuthDigestShmemSize  size   
Default:   AuthDigestShmemSize 1000  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_auth_digest 

 The  AuthDigestShmemSize  directive defines
    the amount of shared memory, that will be allocated at the server
    startup for keeping track of clients. Note that the shared memory
    segment cannot be set less than the space that is necessary for
    tracking at least  one  client. This value is dependent on your
    system. If you want to find out the exact value, you may simply
    set  AuthDigestShmemSize  to the value of
     0  and read the error message after trying to start the
    server. 

     The  size  is normally expressed in Bytes, but you
    may follow the number with a  K  or an  M  to
    express your value as KBytes or MBytes. For example, the following
    directives are all equivalent: 

 AuthDigestShmemSize 1048576
AuthDigestShmemSize 1024K
AuthDigestShmemSize 1M
