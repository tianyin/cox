Action

Description:  Activates a CGI script for a particular handler or
content-type 
Syntax:   Action  action-type   cgi-script  [virtual]  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_actions 
Compatibility:  The  virtual  modifier and handler passing were
introduced in Apache 2.1 

 This directive adds an action, which will activate
     cgi-script  when  action-type  is triggered by
    the request.  The  cgi-script  is the URL-path to a
    resource that has been designated as a CGI script using   ScriptAlias   or   AddHandler  .  The
     action-type  can be either a  handler  or a  MIME content type . It sends the URL and
    file path of the requested document using the standard CGI
     PATH_INFO  and  PATH_TRANSLATED 
    environment variables. The handler used for the particular request
    is passed using the  REDIRECT_HANDLER  variable. 

      Example: MIME type  # Requests for files of a particular MIME content type:
Action image/gif /cgi-bin/images.cgi 
 

     In this example, requests for files with a MIME content
    type of  image/gif  will be handled by the
    specified cgi script  /cgi-bin/images.cgi . 

      Example: File extension  # Files of a particular file extension
AddHandler my-file-type .xyz
Action my-file-type /cgi-bin/program.cgi 
 
     In this example, requests for files with a file extension of
     .xyz  are handled by the specified cgi script
     /cgi-bin/program.cgi . 

     The optional  virtual  modifier turns off the check
    whether the requested file really exists. This is useful, for example,
    if you want to use the  Action  directive in
    virtual locations. 

     < Location /news >
    SetHandler news-handler
    Action news-handler /cgi-bin/news.cgi virtual
< /Location >
