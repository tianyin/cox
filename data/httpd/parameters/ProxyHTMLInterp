ProxyHTMLInterp

Description:  Enables per-request interpolation of
 ProxyHTMLURLMap  rules. 
Syntax:   ProxyHTMLInterp  On|Off   
Default:   ProxyHTMLInterp Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_proxy_html 
Compatibility:  Version 2.4 and later; available as a third-party
for earlier 2.x versions 

 This enables per-request interpolation in
     ProxyHTMLURLMap  to- and from- patterns. 
     If interpolation is not enabled, all rules are pre-compiled at startup.
    With interpolation, they must be re-compiled for every request, which
    implies an extra processing overhead.  It should therefore be
    enabled only when necessary.
