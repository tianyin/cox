 The  IndexIgnore  directive adds to the
    list of files to hide when listing a directory.  File  is a
    shell-style wildcard expression or full
    filename. Multiple IndexIgnore directives add
    to the list, rather than replacing the list of ignored
    files. By default, the list contains  .  (the current
    directory).
