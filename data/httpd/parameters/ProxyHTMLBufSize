ProxyHTMLBufSize

Description:  Sets the buffer size increment for buffering inline scripts and
stylesheets. 
Syntax:   ProxyHTMLBufSize  bytes   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_proxy_html 
Compatibility:  Version 2.4 and later; available as a third-party
for earlier 2.x versions 

 In order to parse non-HTML content (stylesheets and scripts) embedded
in HTML documents, mod_proxy_html
has to read the entire script or stylesheet into a buffer.  This buffer will
be expanded as necessary to hold the largest script or stylesheet in a page,
in increments of  bytes  as set by this directive. 
 The default is 8192, and will work well for almost all pages.  However,
if you know you're proxying pages containing stylesheets and/or
scripts bigger than 8K (that is, for a single script or stylesheet,
NOT in total), it will be more efficient to set a larger buffer
size and avoid the need to resize the buffer dynamically during a request.
