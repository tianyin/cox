LimitRequestBody

Description:  Restricts the total size of the HTTP request body sent
from the client 
Syntax:   LimitRequestBody  bytes   
Default:   LimitRequestBody 0  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  All 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 This directive specifies the number of  bytes  from 0
    (meaning unlimited) to 2147483647 (2GB) that are allowed in a
    request body. See the note below for the limited applicability
    to proxy requests. 

     The  LimitRequestBody  directive allows
    the user to set a limit on the allowed size of an HTTP request
    message body within the context in which the directive is given
    (server, per-directory, per-file or per-location). If the client
    request exceeds that limit, the server will return an error
    response instead of servicing the request. The size of a normal
    request message body will vary greatly depending on the nature of
    the resource and the methods allowed on that resource. CGI scripts
    typically use the message body for retrieving form information.
    Implementations of the  PUT  method will require
    a value at least as large as any representation that the server
    wishes to accept for that resource. 

     This directive gives the server administrator greater
    control over abnormal client request behavior, which may be
    useful for avoiding some forms of denial-of-service
    attacks. 

     If, for example, you are permitting file upload to a particular
    location, and wish to limit the size of the uploaded file to 100K,
    you might use the following directive: 

     LimitRequestBody 102400 


      For a full description of how this directive is interpreted by
    proxy requests, see the   mod_proxy   documentation.
