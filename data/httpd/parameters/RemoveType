RemoveType

Description:  Removes any content type associations for a set of file
extensions 
Syntax:   RemoveType  extension  [ extension ]
...  
Context:  virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_mime 

 The  RemoveType  directive removes any
     media type  associations for files with
    the given extensions. This allows  .htaccess  files in
    subdirectories to undo any associations inherited from parent
    directories or the server config files. An example of its use
    might be: 

      /foo/.htaccess:  RemoveType .cgi 
 

     This will remove any special handling of  .cgi 
    files in the  /foo/  directory and any beneath it,
    causing responses containing those files to omit the HTTP
    Content-Type header field. 

      Note 
        RemoveType  directives are processed
       after  any   AddType  
      directives, so it is possible they may undo the effects of the
      latter if both occur within the same directory configuration. 
     

     The  extension  argument is case-insensitive and can
    be specified with or without a leading dot.
