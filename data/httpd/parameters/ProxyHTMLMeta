ProxyHTMLMeta

Description:  Turns on or off extra pre-parsing of metadata in HTML
 < head >  sections. 
Syntax:   ProxyHTMLMeta  On|Off   
Default:   ProxyHTMLMeta Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_proxy_html 
Compatibility:  Version 2.4 and later; available as a third-party

 This turns on or off pre-parsing of metadata in HTML
     < head >  sections. 
     If not required, turning ProxyHTMLMeta Off will give a small
    performance boost by skipping this parse step.  However, it
    is sometimes necessary for internationalisation to work correctly. 
     ProxyHTMLMeta has two effects.  Firstly and most importantly
    it enables detection of character encodings declared in the form 
     < meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset= foo " > 
     or, in the case of an XHTML document, an XML declaration.
    It is NOT required if the charset is declared in a real HTTP header
    (which is always preferable) from the backend server, nor if the
    document is  utf-8  (unicode) or a subset such as ASCII.
    You may also be able to dispense with it where documents use a
    default declared using   xml2EncDefault  , but that risks propagating an
    incorrect declaration.  A  ProxyHTMLCharsetOut 
    can remove that risk, but is likely to be a bigger processing
    overhead than enabling ProxyHTMLMeta. 
     The other effect of enabling ProxyHTMLMeta is to parse all
     < meta http-equiv=... >  declarations and convert
    them to real HTTP headers, in keeping with the original purpose
    of this form of the HTML < meta > element.
