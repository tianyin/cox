AuthBasicAuthoritative

Description:  Sets whether authorization and authentication are passed to
lower level modules 
Syntax:   AuthBasicAuthoritative On|Off  
Default:   AuthBasicAuthoritative On  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_auth_basic 

 Normally, each authorization module listed in   AuthBasicProvider   will attempt
    to verify the user, and if the user is not found in any provider,
    access will be denied. Setting the
     AuthBasicAuthoritative  directive explicitly
    to  Off  allows for both authentication and
    authorization to be passed on to other non-provider-based modules
    if there is  no userID  or  rule 
    matching the supplied userID.  This should only be necessary when
    combining   mod_auth_basic   with third-party modules
    that are not configured with the   AuthBasicProvider  
    directive.  When using such modules, the order of processing
    is determined in the modules' source code and is not configurable.
