ProxyPassReverse

Description:  Adjusts the URL in HTTP response headers sent from a reverse
proxied server 
Syntax:   ProxyPassReverse [ path ]  url 
[ interpolate ]  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 

 This directive lets Apache httpd adjust the URL in the  Location ,
     Content-Location  and  URI  headers on HTTP
    redirect responses. This is essential when Apache httpd is used as a
    reverse proxy (or gateway) to avoid by-passing the reverse proxy
    because of HTTP redirects on the backend servers which stay behind
    the reverse proxy. 

     Only the HTTP response headers specifically mentioned above
    will be rewritten. Apache httpd will not rewrite other response
    headers, nor will it by default rewrite URL references inside HTML pages.
    This means that if the proxied content contains absolute URL
    references, they will by-pass the proxy. To rewrite HTML content to
    match the proxy, you must load and enable   mod_proxy_html  .
     

      path  is the name of a local virtual path.  url  is a
    partial URL for the remote server - the same way they are used for the
      ProxyPass   directive. 

     For example, suppose the local server has address
     http://example.com/ ; then 

     ProxyPass         /mirror/foo/ http://backend.example.com/
ProxyPassReverse  /mirror/foo/ http://backend.example.com/
ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain  backend.example.com  public.example.com
ProxyPassReverseCookiePath  /  /mirror/foo/ 


     will not only cause a local request for the
     http://example.com/mirror/foo/bar  to be internally converted
    into a proxy request to  http://backend.example.com/bar 
    (the functionality  ProxyPass  provides here). It also takes care
    of redirects the server  backend.example.com  sends: when
     http://backend.example.com/bar  is redirected by him to
     http://backend.example.com/quux  Apache httpd adjusts this to
     http://example.com/mirror/foo/quux  before forwarding the HTTP
    redirect response to the client. Note that the hostname used for
    constructing the URL is chosen in respect to the setting of the   UseCanonicalName   directive. 

     Note that this  ProxyPassReverse  directive can
    also be used in conjunction with the proxy pass-through feature
    ( RewriteRule ...  [P] ) from   mod_rewrite  
    because it doesn't depend on a corresponding   ProxyPass   directive. 

     The optional  interpolate  keyword, used together with
     ProxyPassInterpolateEnv , enables interpolation
    of environment variables specified using the format  ${VARNAME} .
    Note that interpolation is not supported within the scheme portion of a
    URL. 

     When used inside a   < Location >   section, the first argument is omitted and the local
    directory is obtained from the   < Location >  . The same occurs inside a   < LocationMatch >   section, but will probably not work as
    intended, as ProxyPassReverse will interpret the regexp literally as a
    path; if needed in this situation, specify the ProxyPassReverse outside
    the section, or in a separate   < Location >   section. 

     This directive is not supported in   < Directory >   or   < Files >   sections.
