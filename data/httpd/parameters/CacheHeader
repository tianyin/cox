Description:  Add an X-Cache header to the response. 
Syntax:   CacheHeader  on|off   
Default:   CacheHeader off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache 2.3.9 and later 

 When the   CacheHeader   directive
  is switched on, an  X-Cache  header will be added to the response
  with the cache status of this response. If the normal handler is used, this
  directive may appear within a   < Directory >  
  or   < Location >   directive. If the quick
  handler is used, this directive must appear within a server or virtual host
  context, otherwise the setting will be ignored.
