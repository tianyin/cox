DBDPrepareSQL

Description:  Define an SQL prepared statement 
Syntax:   DBDPrepareSQL  "SQL statement"   label   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_dbd 

 For modules such as authentication that repeatedly use a
    single SQL statement, optimum performance is achieved by preparing
    the statement at startup rather than every time it is used.
    This directive prepares an SQL statement and assigns it a label.
