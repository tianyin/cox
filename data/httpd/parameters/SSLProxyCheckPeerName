SSLProxyCheckPeerName

Description:  Configure host name checking for remote server certificates
 
Syntax:   SSLProxyCheckPeerName on|off  
Default:   SSLProxyCheckPeerName on  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 
Compatibility:  Apache HTTP Server 2.4.5 and later 

 
This directive configures host name checking for server certificates
when mod_ssl is acting as an SSL client. The check will
succeed if the host name from the request URI is found in
either the subjectAltName extension or (one of) the CN attribute(s)
in the certificate's subject. If the check fails, the SSL request
is aborted and a 502 status code (Bad Gateway) is returned.
The directive supersedes   SSLProxyCheckPeerCN  ,
which only checks for the expected host name in the first CN attribute.
 
 
Wildcard matching is supported in one specific flavor: subjectAltName entries
of type dNSName or CN attributes starting with  *.  will match
for any DNS name with the same number of labels and the same suffix
(i.e.,  *.example.org  matches for  foo.example.org ,
but not for  foo.bar.example.org ).
