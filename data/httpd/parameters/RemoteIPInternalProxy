 The   RemoteIPInternalProxy   directive adds one
    or more addresses (or address blocks) to trust as presenting a valid
    RemoteIPHeader value of the useragent IP.  Unlike the
      RemoteIPTrustedProxy   directive, any IP address
    presented in this header, including private intranet addresses, are
    trusted when passed from these proxies.
