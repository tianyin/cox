UseCanonicalPhysicalPort

Description:  Configures how the server determines its own port 
Syntax:   UseCanonicalPhysicalPort On|Off  
Default:   UseCanonicalPhysicalPort Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 In many situations Apache httpd must construct a  self-referential 
    URL -- that is, a URL that refers back to the same server. With
     UseCanonicalPhysicalPort On  Apache httpd will, when
    constructing the canonical port for the server to honor
    the   UseCanonicalName   directive,
    provide the actual physical port number being used by this request
    as a potential port. With  UseCanonicalPhysicalPort Off 
    Apache httpd will not ever use the actual physical port number, instead
    relying on all configured information to construct a valid port number. 

      Note 
     The ordering of the lookup when the physical port is used is as
    follows: 
        UseCanonicalName On  
      
       Port provided in   Servername   
       Physical port 
       Default port 
       
       UseCanonicalName Off | DNS  
      
       Parsed port from  Host:  header 
       Physical port 
       Port provided in   Servername   
       Default port 
       
       With  UseCanonicalPhysicalPort Off , the
    physical ports are removed from the ordering.
