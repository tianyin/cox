Options

Description:  Configures what features are available in a particular
directory 
Syntax:   Options
    [+|-] option  [[+|-] option ] ...  
Default:   Options FollowSymlinks  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  Options 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 
Compatibility:  The default was changed from All to FollowSymlinks in 2.3.11 

 The  Options  directive controls which
    server features are available in a particular directory. 

      option  can be set to  None , in which
    case none of the extra features are enabled, or one or more of
    the following: 

       All  

       All options except for  MultiViews . 

        ExecCGI  

       
      Execution of CGI scripts using   mod_cgi  
      is permitted. 

        FollowSymLinks  

       
      The server will follow symbolic links in this directory. This is
      the default setting.
       
       Even though the server follows the symlink it does  not 
      change the pathname used to match against   < Directory >   sections. 

       The  FollowSymLinks  and
       SymLinksIfOwnerMatch    Options   work only in   < Directory >   sections or
       .htaccess  files. 

       Omitting this option should not be considered a security restriction,
      since symlink testing is subject to race conditions that make it
      circumventable. 
        

        Includes  

       
      Server-side includes provided by   mod_include  
      are permitted. 

        IncludesNOEXEC  

       

      Server-side includes are permitted, but the  #exec
      cmd  and  #exec cgi  are disabled. It is still
      possible to  #include virtual  CGI scripts from
        ScriptAlias  ed
      directories. 

        Indexes  

       
      If a URL which maps to a directory is requested, and there
      is no   DirectoryIndex  
      ( e.g. ,  index.html ) in that directory, then
        mod_autoindex   will return a formatted listing
      of the directory. 

        MultiViews  

       
       Content negotiated 
      "MultiViews" are allowed using
        mod_negotiation  .
        Note   This option gets ignored if set
      anywhere other than   < Directory >  , as   mod_negotiation  
      needs real resources to compare against and evaluate from.  
       

        SymLinksIfOwnerMatch  

       The server will only follow symbolic links for which the
      target file or directory is owned by the same user id as the
      link.

        Note 
       The  FollowSymLinks  and
       SymLinksIfOwnerMatch    Options   work only in   < Directory >   sections or
       .htaccess  files. 

       This option should not be considered a security restriction,
      since symlink testing is subject to race conditions that make it
      circumventable. 
         
      Normally, if multiple  Options  could
    apply to a directory, then the most specific one is used and
    others are ignored; the options are not merged. (See  how sections are merged .)
    However if  all  the options on the
     Options  directive are preceded by a
     +  or  -  symbol, the options are
    merged. Any options preceded by a  +  are added to the
    options currently in force, and any options preceded by a
     -  are removed from the options currently in
    force.  

      Note 
     Mixing  Options  with a  +  or
     -  with those without is not valid syntax, and will be
    rejected during server startup by the syntax check with an abort. 
     

     For example, without any  +  and  -  symbols: 

     < Directory "/web/docs" >
  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
< /Directory >

< Directory "/web/docs/spec" >
  Options Includes
< /Directory > 


     then only  Includes  will be set for the
     /web/docs/spec  directory. However if the second
     Options  directive uses the  +  and
     -  symbols: 

     < Directory "/web/docs" >
  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
< /Directory >

< Directory "/web/docs/spec" >
  Options +Includes -Indexes
< /Directory > 


     then the options  FollowSymLinks  and
     Includes  are set for the  /web/docs/spec 
    directory. 

      Note 
       Using  -IncludesNOEXEC  or
       -Includes  disables server-side includes completely
      regardless of the previous setting. 
     

     The default in the absence of any other settings is
     FollowSymlinks .
