HostnameLookups

Description:  Enables DNS lookups on client IP addresses 
Syntax:   HostnameLookups On|Off|Double  
Default:   HostnameLookups Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 This directive enables DNS lookups so that host names can be
    logged (and passed to CGIs/SSIs in  REMOTE_HOST ).
    The value  Double  refers to doing double-reverse
    DNS lookup. That is, after a reverse lookup is performed, a forward
    lookup is then performed on that result. At least one of the IP
    addresses in the forward lookup must match the original
    address. (In "tcpwrappers" terminology this is called
     PARANOID .) 

     Regardless of the setting, when   mod_authz_host   is
    used for controlling access by hostname, a double reverse lookup
    will be performed.  This is necessary for security. Note that the
    result of this double-reverse isn't generally available unless you
    set  HostnameLookups Double . For example, if only
     HostnameLookups On  and a request is made to an object
    that is protected by hostname restrictions, regardless of whether
    the double-reverse fails or not, CGIs will still be passed the
    single-reverse result in  REMOTE_HOST . 

     The default is  Off  in order to save the network
    traffic for those sites that don't truly need the reverse
    lookups done. It is also better for the end users because they
    don't have to suffer the extra latency that a lookup entails.
    Heavily loaded sites should leave this directive
     Off , since DNS lookups can take considerable
    amounts of time. The utility   logresolve  , compiled by
    default to the  bin  subdirectory of your installation
    directory, can be used to look up host names from logged IP addresses
    offline. 

     Finally, if you have  hostname-based Require
    directives , a hostname lookup will be performed regardless of
    the setting of  HostnameLookups .
