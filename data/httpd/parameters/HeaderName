HeaderName

Description:  Name of the file that will be inserted at the top
of the index listing 
Syntax:   HeaderName  filename   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  Indexes 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_autoindex 

 The  HeaderName  directive sets the name
    of the file that will be inserted at the top of the index
    listing.  Filename  is the name of the file to include. 

     HeaderName HEADER.html 


     
       Both HeaderName and   ReadmeName   now treat
       Filename  as a URI path relative to the one used to
      access the directory being indexed. If  Filename  begins
      with a slash, it will be taken to be relative to the   DocumentRoot  . 

       HeaderName /include/HEADER.html 


        Filename  must resolve to a document with a major
      content type of  text/*  ( e.g. ,
       text/html ,  text/plain , etc.). This means
      that  filename  may refer to a CGI script if the script's
      actual file type (as opposed to its output) is marked as
       text/html  such as with a directive like: 

       AddType text/html .cgi 


        Content negotiation 
      will be performed if   Options  
       MultiViews  is in effect. If  filename  resolves
      to a static  text/html  document (not a CGI script) and
      either one of the   options  
       Includes  or  IncludesNOEXEC  is enabled,
      the file will be processed for server-side includes (see the
        mod_include   documentation). 
     

     If the file specified by  HeaderName  contains
    the beginnings of an HTML document (< html >, < head >, etc.)
    then you will probably want to set   IndexOptions
    +SuppressHTMLPreamble  , so that these tags are not
    repeated.
