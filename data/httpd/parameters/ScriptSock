ScriptSock

Description:  The filename prefix of the socket to use for communication with
the cgi daemon 
Syntax:   ScriptSock  file-path   
Default:   ScriptSock cgisock  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_cgid 

 This directive sets the filename prefix of the socket to use for
    communication with the CGI daemon, an extension corresponding to
    the process ID of the server will be appended. The socket will be opened
    using the permissions of the user who starts Apache (usually
    root). To maintain the security of communications with CGI
    scripts, it is important that no other user has permission to
    write in the directory where the socket is located. 

     If  file-path  is not an absolute path, the location specified
    will be relative to the value of 
      DefaultRuntimeDir  . 

      Example  ScriptSock /var/run/cgid.sock
