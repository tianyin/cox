ForceType

Description:  Forces all matching files to be served with the specified
media type in the HTTP Content-Type header field 
Syntax:   ForceType  media-type |None  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 When placed into an  .htaccess  file or a
      < Directory >  , or
      < Location >   or
      < Files >  
    section, this directive forces all matching files to be served
    with the content type identification given by
     media-type . For example, if you had a directory full of
    GIF files, but did not want to label them all with  .gif ,
    you might want to use: 

     ForceType image/gif 


     Note that this directive overrides other indirect media type
    associations defined in mime.types or via the
      AddType  . 

     You can also override more general
     ForceType  settings
    by using the value of  None : 

     # force all files to be image/gif:
< Location /images >
  ForceType image/gif
< /Location >

# but normal mime-type associations here:
< Location /images/mixed >
  ForceType None
< /Location > 


     This directive primarily overrides the content types generated for
    static files served out of the filesystem.  For resources other than
    static files, where the generator of the response typically specifies
    a Content-Type, this directive has no effect.
