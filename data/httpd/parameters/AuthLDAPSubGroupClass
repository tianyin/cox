 An LDAP group object may contain members that are users and
    members that are groups (called nested or sub groups). The
     AuthLDAPSubGroupAttribute  directive identifies the
    labels of members that may be sub-groups of the current group
    (as opposed to user members). The  AuthLDAPSubGroupClass 
    directive specifies the LDAP objectClass values used in verifying that
    these potential sub-groups are in fact group objects. Verified sub-groups
    can then be searched for more user or sub-group members. Multiple
    attributes can be used by specifying this directive multiple times.
    If not specified, then   mod_authnz_ldap   uses the
     groupOfNames  and  groupOfUniqueNames  values.
