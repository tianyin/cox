SSLCADNRequestFile

Description:  File of concatenated PEM-encoded CA Certificates
for defining acceptable CA names 
Syntax:   SSLCADNRequestFile  file-path   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

 When a client certificate is requested by mod_ssl, a list of
 acceptable Certificate Authority names  is sent to the client
in the SSL handshake.  These CA names can be used by the client to
select an appropriate client certificate out of those it has
available. 

 If neither of the directives   SSLCADNRequestPath   or   SSLCADNRequestFile   are given, then the
set of acceptable CA names sent to the client is the names of all the
CA certificates given by the   SSLCACertificateFile   and   SSLCACertificatePath   directives; in other
words, the names of the CAs which will actually be used to verify the
client certificate. 

 In some circumstances, it is useful to be able to send a set of
acceptable CA names which differs from the actual CAs used to verify
the client certificate - for example, if the client certificates are
signed by intermediate CAs.  In such cases,   SSLCADNRequestPath   and/or   SSLCADNRequestFile   can be used; the
acceptable CA names are then taken from the complete set of
certificates in the directory and/or file specified by this pair of
directives. 

   SSLCADNRequestFile   must
specify an  all-in-one  file containing a concatenation of
PEM-encoded CA certificates. 

  Example  SSLCADNRequestFile /usr/local/apache2/conf/ca-names.crt
