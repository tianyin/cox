AddDescription

Description:  Description to display for a file 
Syntax:   AddDescription  string file  [ file ] ...  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  Indexes 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_autoindex 

 This sets the description to display for a file, for
      FancyIndexing  .
     File  is a file extension, partial filename, wild-card
    expression or full filename for files to describe.
     String  is enclosed in double quotes ( " ). 

     AddDescription "The planet Mars" mars.gif
AddDescription "My friend Marshall" friends/mars.gif 


     The typical, default description field is 23 bytes wide. 6
    more bytes are added by the   IndexOptions SuppressIcon   option, 7 bytes are
    added by the   IndexOptions SuppressSize   option, and 19 bytes are
    added by the   IndexOptions SuppressLastModified   option.
    Therefore, the widest default the description column is ever
    assigned is 55 bytes. 

     Since the  File  argument may be a partial file name,
    please remember that a too-short partial filename may match
    unintended files. For example,  le.html  will match the
    file  le.html  but will also match the file
     example.html . In the event that there may be ambiguity,
    use as complete a filename as you can, but keep in mind that the
    first match encountered will be used, and order your list of
     AddDescription  directives accordingly. 

     See the  DescriptionWidth    IndexOptions   keyword for details on overriding the size
    of this column, or allowing descriptions of unlimited length. 

      Caution 
       Descriptive text defined with  AddDescription 
      may contain HTML markup, such as tags and character entities. If the
      width of the description column should happen to truncate a tagged
      element (such as cutting off the end of a bolded phrase), the
      results may affect the rest of the directory listing. 
     

      Arguments with path information 
       Absolute paths are not currently supported and do not match
      anything at runtime. Arguments with relative path information,
      which would normally only be used in htaccess context, are implicitly 
      prefixed with '*/' to avoid matching partial directory names.
