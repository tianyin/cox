DefaultLanguage

Description:  Defines a default language-tag to be sent in the Content-Language
header field for all resources in the current context that have not been
assigned a language-tag by some other means. 
Syntax:   DefaultLanguage  language-tag   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_mime 

 The  DefaultLanguage  directive tells Apache
    that all resources in the directive's scope ( e.g. , all resources
    covered by the current   < Directory >   container) that don't have an explicit language
    extension (such as  .fr  or  .de  as configured
    by   AddLanguage  ) should be
    assigned a Content-Language of  language-tag . This allows
    entire directory trees to be marked as containing Dutch content, for
    instance, without having to rename each file. Note that unlike using
    extensions to specify languages,  DefaultLanguage 
    can only specify a single language. 

     If no  DefaultLanguage  directive is in force
    and a file does not have any language extensions as configured
    by   AddLanguage  , then no
    Content-Language header field will be generated.
