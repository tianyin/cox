AllowOverrideList

Description:  Individual directives that are allowed in
 .htaccess  files 
Syntax:   AllowOverrideList None| directive 
[ directive-type ] ...  
Default:   AllowOverrideList None  
Context:  directory 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 When the server finds an  .htaccess  file (as
    specified by   AccessFileName  )
    it needs to know which directives declared in that file can override
    earlier configuration directives. 

      Only available in < Directory > sections 
     AllowOverrideList  is valid only in
      < Directory >  
    sections specified without regular expressions, not in   < Location >  ,   < DirectoryMatch >   or
      < Files >   sections.
     

     When this directive is set to  None  and   AllowOverride   is set to  None ,
    then  .htaccess  files are completely
    ignored.  In this case, the server will not even attempt to read
     .htaccess  files in the filesystem. 

     Example: 

     AllowOverride None
AllowOverrideList Redirect RedirectMatch 


     In the example above only the  Redirect  and
     RedirectMatch  directives are allowed. All others will
    cause an internal server error. 

     Example: 

     AllowOverride AuthConfig
AllowOverrideList CookieTracking CookieName 


     In the example above   AllowOverride
       grants permission to the  AuthConfig 
    directive grouping and  AllowOverrideList  grants
    permission to only two directives from the  FileInfo  directive
    grouping. All others will cause an internal server error.
