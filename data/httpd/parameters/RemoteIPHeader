RemoteIPHeader

Description:  Declare the header field which should be parsed for useragent IP addresses 
Syntax:   RemoteIPHeader  header-field   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_remoteip 

 The   RemoteIPHeader   directive triggers
      mod_remoteip   to treat the value of the specified
     header-field  header as the useragent IP address, or list
    of intermediate useragent IP addresses, subject to further configuration
    of the   RemoteIPInternalProxy   and
      RemoteIPTrustedProxy   directives.  Unless these
    other directives are used,   mod_remoteip   will trust all
    hosts presenting a   RemoteIPHeader   IP value.
