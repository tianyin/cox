AsyncRequestWorkerFactor

Description:  Limit concurrent connections per process 
Syntax:   AsyncRequestWorkerFactor  factor   
Default:   2  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:  event 
Compatibility:  Available in version 2.3.13 and later 

 The event MPM handles some connections in an asynchronous way, where
    request worker threads are only allocated for short periods of time as
    needed, and other connections with one request worker thread reserved per
    connection. This can lead to situations where all workers are tied up and
    no worker thread is available to handle new work on established async
    connections. 

     To mitigate this problem, the event MPM does two things: Firstly, it
    limits the number of connections accepted per process, depending on the
    number of idle request workers. Secondly, if all workers are busy, it will
    close connections in keep-alive state even if the keep-alive timeout has
    not expired. This allows the respective clients to reconnect to a
    different process which may still have worker threads available. 

     This directive can be used to fine-tune the per-process connection
    limit. A process will only accept new connections if the current number of
    connections (not counting connections in the "closing" state) is lower
    than: 

      
          ThreadsPerChild   +
        ( AsyncRequestWorkerFactor  *
         number of idle workers )
      

     This means the absolute maximum numbers of concurrent connections is: 

      
        ( AsyncRequestWorkerFactor  + 1) *
          MaxRequestWorkers  
      

       MaxRequestWorkers   was called
     MaxClients  prior to version 2.3.13. The above value
    shows that the old name did not accurately describe its meaning for the event MPM. 

      AsyncRequestWorkerFactor  can take non-integer
    arguments, e.g "1.5".
