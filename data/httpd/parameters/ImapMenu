ImapMenu

Description:  Action if no coordinates are given when calling
an imagemap 
Syntax:   ImapMenu none|formatted|semiformatted|unformatted  
Default:   ImapMenu formatted  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  Indexes 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_imagemap 

 The  ImapMenu  directive determines the
    action taken if an imagemap file is called without valid
    coordinates. 

       none  
       If ImapMenu is  none , no menu is generated,
      and the  default  action is performed. 

        formatted  
       A  formatted  menu is the simplest menu.
      Comments in the imagemap file are ignored. A level one header
      is printed, then an hrule, then the links each on a separate
      line. The menu has a consistent, plain look close to that of
      a directory listing. 

        semiformatted  
       In the  semiformatted  menu, comments are
      printed where they occur in the imagemap file. Blank lines
      are turned into HTML breaks. No header or hrule is printed,
      but otherwise the menu is the same as a
       formatted  menu. 

        unformatted  
       Comments are printed, blank lines are ignored. Nothing is
      printed that does not appear in the imagemap file. All breaks
      and headers must be included as comments in the imagemap
      file. This gives you the most flexibility over the appearance
      of your menus, but requires you to treat your map files as
      HTML instead of plaintext.
