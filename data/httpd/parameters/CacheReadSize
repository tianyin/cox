CacheReadSize

Description:  The minimum size (in bytes) of the document to read and be cached
  before sending the data downstream 
Syntax:   CacheReadSize  bytes   
Default:   CacheReadSize 0  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache_disk 

 The  CacheReadSize  directive sets the
    minimum amount of data, in bytes, to be read from the backend before the
    data is sent to the client. The default of zero causes all data read of
    any size to be passed downstream to the client immediately as it arrives.
    Setting this to a higher value causes the disk cache to buffer at least
    this amount before sending the result to the client. This can improve
    performance when caching content from a reverse proxy. 

     This directive only takes effect when the data is being saved to the
    cache, as opposed to data being served from the cache.
