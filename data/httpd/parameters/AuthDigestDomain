AuthDigestDomain

Description:  URIs that are in the same protection space for digest
authentication 
Syntax:   AuthDigestDomain  URI  [ URI ] ...  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_auth_digest 

 The  AuthDigestDomain  directive allows
    you to specify one or more URIs which are in the same protection
    space ( i.e.  use the same realm and username/password info).
    The specified URIs are prefixes; the client will assume
    that all URIs "below" these are also protected by the same
    username/password. The URIs may be either absolute URIs ( i.e. 
    including a scheme, host, port, etc.) or relative URIs. 

     This directive  should  always be specified and
    contain at least the (set of) root URI(s) for this space.
    Omitting to do so will cause the client to send the
    Authorization header for  every request  sent to this
    server. 

     The URIs specified can also point to different servers, in
    which case clients (which understand this) will then share
    username/password info across multiple servers without
    prompting the user each time.
