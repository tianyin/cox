Description:  Specifies userIDs that are allowed access without
password verification 
Syntax:   Anonymous  user  [ user ] ...  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_authn_anon 

 A list of one or more 'magic' userIDs which are allowed
    access without password verification. The userIDs are space
    separated. It is possible to use the ' and " quotes to allow a
    space in a userID as well as the \ escape character. 

     Please note that the comparison is
     case-IN-sensitive . 
    It's strongly recommended that the magic username
    ' anonymous ' is always one of the allowed
    userIDs. 

      Example:  Anonymous anonymous "Not Registered" "I don't know" 
 

     This would allow the user to enter without password
    verification by using the userIDs "anonymous",
    "AnonyMous", "Not Registered" and "I Don't Know". 

     As of Apache 2.1 it is possible to specify the userID as
    " * ". That allows  any  supplied userID to be
    accepted.
