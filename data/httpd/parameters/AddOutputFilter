AddOutputFilter

Description:  Maps filename extensions to the filters that will process
responses from the server 
Syntax:   AddOutputFilter  filter [; filter ...]
 extension  [ extension ] ...  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_mime 

 The  AddOutputFilter  directive maps the
    filename extension  extension  to the  filters  which will process responses
    from the server before they are sent to the client. This is in
    addition to any filters defined elsewhere, including   SetOutputFilter   and   AddOutputFilterByType   directive. This mapping is merged
    over any already in force, overriding any mappings that already exist
    for the same  extension . 

     For example, the following configuration will process all
     .shtml  files for server-side includes and will then
    compress the output using   mod_deflate  . 

     AddOutputFilter INCLUDES;DEFLATE shtml 


     If more than one filter is specified, they must be separated
    by semicolons in the order in which they should process the
    content. The  filter  argument is case-insensitive. 

     The  extension  argument is case-insensitive and can
    be specified with or without a leading dot. Filenames may have  multiple extensions  and the
     extension  argument will be compared against each of
    them. 

     Note that when defining a set of filters using the
      AddOutputFilter   directive,
    any definition made will replace any previous definition made by
    the   AddOutputFilter  
    directive. 

     # Effective filter "DEFLATE"
AddOutputFilter DEFLATE shtml
< Location /foo >
  # Effective filter "INCLUDES", replacing "DEFLATE"
  AddOutputFilter INCLUDES shtml
< /Location >
< Location /bar >
  # Effective filter "INCLUDES;DEFLATE", replacing "DEFLATE"
  AddOutputFilter INCLUDES;DEFLATE shtml
< /Location >
< Location /bar/baz >
  # Effective filter "BUFFER", replacing "INCLUDES;DEFLATE"
  AddOutputFilter BUFFER shtml
< /Location >
< Location /bar/baz/buz >
  # No effective filter, replacing "BUFFER"
  RemoveOutputFilter shtml
< /Location >
