ChrootDir

Description:  Directory for apache to run chroot(8) after startup. 
Syntax:   ChrootDir  /path/to/directory   
Default:   none  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Base 
Module:    mod_unixd   
Compatibility:  Available in Apache 2.2.10 and later 

 This directive tells the server to  chroot(8)  to the
    specified directory after startup, but before accepting requests
    over the 'net. 
     Note that running the server under chroot is not simple,
    and requires additional setup, particularly if you are running
    scripts such as CGI or PHP.  Please make sure you are properly
    familiar with the operation of chroot before attempting to use
    this feature.
