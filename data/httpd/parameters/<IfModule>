<IfModule>

Description:  Encloses directives that are processed conditional on the
presence or absence of a specific module 
Syntax:   < IfModule [!] module-file | module-identifier  > ...
    < /IfModule >  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  All 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 
Compatibility:  Module identifiers are available in version 2.1 and
later. 

 The  < IfModule  test  >...< /IfModule > 
    section is used to mark directives that are conditional on the presence of
    a specific module. The directives within an  < IfModule >  section are only processed if the  test 
    is true. If  test  is false, everything between the start and
    end markers is ignored. 

     The  test  in the  < IfModule >  section directive can be one of two forms: 

       module  

       ! module  
      In the former case, the directives between the start and end
    markers are only processed if the module named  module 
    is included in Apache httpd -- either compiled in or
    dynamically loaded using   LoadModule  . The second format reverses the test,
    and only processes the directives if  module  is
     not  included. 

     The  module  argument can be either the module identifier or
    the file name of the module, at the time it was compiled.  For example,
     rewrite_module  is the identifier and
     mod_rewrite.c  is the file name. If a module consists of
    several source files, use the name of the file containing the string
     STANDARD20_MODULE_STUFF . 

      < IfModule >  sections are
    nest-able, which can be used to implement simple multiple-module
    tests. 

     This section should only be used if you need to have one
    configuration file that works whether or not a specific module
    is available. In normal operation, directives need not be
    placed in  < IfModule > 
    sections.
