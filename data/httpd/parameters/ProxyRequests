ProxyRequests

Description:  Enables forward (standard) proxy requests 
Syntax:   ProxyRequests On|Off  
Default:   ProxyRequests Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 

 This allows or prevents Apache httpd from functioning as a forward proxy
    server. (Setting ProxyRequests to  Off  does not disable use of
    the   ProxyPass   directive.) 

     In a typical reverse proxy or gateway configuration, this
    option should be set to
     Off . 

     In order to get the functionality of proxying HTTP or FTP sites, you
    need also   mod_proxy_http   or   mod_proxy_ftp  
    (or both) present in the server. 

     In order to get the functionality of (forward) proxying HTTPS sites, you
    need   mod_proxy_connect   enabled in the server. 

      Warning 
       Do not enable proxying with   ProxyRequests   until you have  secured your server .  Open proxy servers are dangerous
      both to your network and to the Internet at large.
