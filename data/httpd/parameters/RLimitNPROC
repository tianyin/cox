RLimitNPROC

Description:  Limits the number of processes that can be launched by
processes launched by Apache httpd children 
Syntax:   RLimitNPROC  number |max [ number |max]  
Default:   Unset; uses operating system defaults  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  All 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 Takes 1 or 2 parameters. The first parameter sets the soft
    resource limit for all processes and the second parameter sets
    the maximum resource limit. Either parameter can be a number,
    or  max  to indicate to the server that the limit
    should be set to the maximum allowed by the operating system
    configuration. Raising the maximum resource limit requires that
    the server is running as  root , or in the initial startup
    phase. 

     This applies to processes forked off from Apache httpd children
    servicing requests, not the Apache httpd children themselves. This
    includes CGI scripts and SSI exec commands, but not any
    processes forked off from the Apache httpd parent such as piped
    logs. 

     Process limits control the number of processes per user. 

      Note 
       If CGI processes are  not  running
      under user ids other than the web server user id, this directive
      will limit the number of processes that the server itself can
      create. Evidence of this situation will be indicated by
        cannot fork   messages in the
       error_log .
