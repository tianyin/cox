AuthLDAPMaxSubGroupDepth

Description:  Specifies the maximum sub-group nesting depth that will be
evaluated before the user search is discontinued. 
Syntax:   AuthLDAPMaxSubGroupDepth  Number   
Default:   AuthLDAPMaxSubGroupDepth 10  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_authnz_ldap 
Compatibility:  Available in version 2.3.0 and later 

 When this directive is set to a non-zero value  X 
   combined with use of the  Require ldap-group someGroupDN 
   directive, the provided user credentials will be searched for
   as a member of the  someGroupDN  directory object or of
   any group member of the current group up to the maximum nesting
   level  X  specified by this directive. 
    See the   Require ldap-group  
   section for a more detailed example. 

     Nested groups performance 
     When  AuthLDAPSubGroupAttribute  overlaps with
    AuthLDAPGroupAttribute  (as it does by default and
   as required by common LDAP schemas), uncached searching for subgroups in 
   large groups can be very slow. If you use large, non-nested groups, set 
    AuthLDAPMaxSubGroupDepth  to zero.
