KeepAlive

Description:  Enables HTTP persistent connections 
Syntax:   KeepAlive On|Off  
Default:   KeepAlive On  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 The Keep-Alive extension to HTTP/1.0 and the persistent
    connection feature of HTTP/1.1 provide long-lived HTTP sessions
    which allow multiple requests to be sent over the same TCP
    connection. In some cases this has been shown to result in an
    almost 50% speedup in latency times for HTML documents with
    many images. To enable Keep-Alive connections, set
     KeepAlive On . 

     For HTTP/1.0 clients, Keep-Alive connections will only be
    used if they are specifically requested by a client. In
    addition, a Keep-Alive connection with an HTTP/1.0 client can
    only be used when the length of the content is known in
    advance. This implies that dynamic content such as CGI output,
    SSI pages, and server-generated directory listings will
    generally not use Keep-Alive connections to HTTP/1.0 clients.
    For HTTP/1.1 clients, persistent connections are the default
    unless otherwise specified. If the client requests it, chunked
    encoding will be used in order to send content of unknown
    length over persistent connections. 

     When a client uses a Keep-Alive connection it will be counted
    as a single "request" for the   MaxConnectionsPerChild   directive, regardless
    of how many requests are sent using the connection.
