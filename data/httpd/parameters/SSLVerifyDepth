SSLVerifyDepth

Description:  Maximum depth of CA Certificates in Client
Certificate verification 
Syntax:   SSLVerifyDepth  number   
Default:   SSLVerifyDepth 1  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

 
This directive sets how deeply mod_ssl should verify before deciding that the
clients don't have a valid certificate. Notice that this directive can be
used both in per-server and per-directory context. In per-server context it
applies to the client authentication process used in the standard SSL
handshake when a connection is established. In per-directory context it forces
a SSL renegotiation with the reconfigured client verification depth after the
HTTP request was read but before the HTTP response is sent. 
 
The depth actually is the maximum number of intermediate certificate issuers,
i.e. the number of CA certificates which are max allowed to be followed while
verifying the client certificate. A depth of 0 means that self-signed client
certificates are accepted only, the default depth of 1 means the client
certificate can be self-signed or has to be signed by a CA which is directly
known to the server (i.e. the CA's certificate is under
  SSLCACertificatePath  ), etc. 
  Example  SSLVerifyDepth 10
