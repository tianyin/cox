AuthGroupFile

Description:  Sets the name of a text file containing the list
of user groups for authorization 
Syntax:   AuthGroupFile  file-path   
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_authz_groupfile 

 The  AuthGroupFile  directive sets the
    name of a textual file containing the list of user groups for user
    authorization.  File-path  is the path to the group
    file. If it is not absolute, it is treated as relative to the   ServerRoot  . 

     Each line of the group file contains a groupname followed by a
    colon, followed by the member usernames separated by spaces. 

      Example:   
      mygroup: bob joe anne
       

     Note that searching large text files is  very 
    inefficient;   AuthDBMGroupFile   provides a much better performance. 

      Security 
       Make sure that the  AuthGroupFile  is
      stored outside the document tree of the web-server; do  not 
      put it in the directory that it protects. Otherwise, clients may
      be able to download the  AuthGroupFile .
