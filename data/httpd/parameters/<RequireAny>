<RequireAny>

Description:  Enclose a group of authorization directives of which one
must succeed for the enclosing directive to succeed. 
Syntax:   < RequireAny > ... < /RequireAny >  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_authz_core 

  < RequireAny >  and
     < /RequireAny >  are used to enclose a group of
    authorization directives of which one must succeed in order for
    the  < RequireAny >  directive to
    succeed. 

     If one or more of the directives contained within the
     < RequireAny >  directive succeed,
    then the  < RequireAny >  directive
    succeeds.  If none succeed and none fail, then it returns a
    neutral result.  In all other cases, it fails. 

     Because negated authorization directives are unable to
    return a successful result, they can not significantly influence
    the result of a  < RequireAny > 
    directive.  (At most they could cause the directive to fail in
    the case where they failed and all other directives returned a
    neutral value.)  Therefore negated authorization directives
    are not permitted within a  < RequireAny > 
    directive.
