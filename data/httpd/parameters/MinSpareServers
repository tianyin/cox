MinSpareServers

Description:  Minimum number of idle child server processes 
Syntax:   MinSpareServers  number   
Default:   MinSpareServers 5  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:  prefork 

 The  MinSpareServers  directive sets the
    desired minimum number of  idle  child server processes. An
    idle process is one which is not handling a request. If there are
    fewer than  MinSpareServers  idle, then the parent
    process creates new children: It will spawn one, wait a second, then spawn
    two, wait a second, then spawn four, and it will
    continue exponentially until it is spawning 32 children per second. It will
    stop whenever it satisfies the  MinSpareServers 
    setting. 

     Tuning of this parameter should only be necessary on very
    busy sites. Setting this parameter to a large number is almost
    always a bad idea.
