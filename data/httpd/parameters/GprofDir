GprofDir

Description:  Directory to write gmon.out profiling data to.   
Syntax:   GprofDir  /tmp/gprof/ | /tmp/gprof/ %  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 When the server has been compiled with gprof profiling support,
     GprofDir  causes  gmon.out  files to
    be written to the specified directory when the process exits.  If the
    argument ends with a percent symbol ('%'), subdirectories are created
    for each process id. 

     This directive currently only works with the   prefork  
    MPM.
