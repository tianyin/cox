ScriptLog

Description:  Location of the CGI script error logfile 
Syntax:   ScriptLog  file-path   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Base 
Module:    mod_cgi  ,   mod_cgid   

 The  ScriptLog  directive sets the CGI
    script error logfile. If no  ScriptLog  is given,
    no error log is created. If given, any CGI errors are logged into the
    filename given as argument. If this is a relative file or path it is
    taken relative to the   ServerRoot  .
     

      Example  ScriptLog logs/cgi_log 
 

     This log will be opened as the user the child processes run
    as,  i.e.  the user specified in the main   User   directive. This means that
    either the directory the script log is in needs to be writable
    by that user or the file needs to be manually created and set
    to be writable by that user. If you place the script log in
    your main logs directory, do  NOT  change the
    directory permissions to make it writable by the user the child
    processes run as. 

     Note that script logging is meant to be a debugging feature
    when writing CGI scripts, and is not meant to be activated
    continuously on running servers. It is not optimized for speed
    or efficiency, and may have security problems if used in a
    manner other than that for which it was designed.
