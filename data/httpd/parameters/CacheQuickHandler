CacheQuickHandler

Description:  Run the cache from the quick handler. 
Syntax:   CacheQuickHandler  on|off   
Default:   CacheQuickHandler on  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache 
Compatibility:  Apache HTTP Server 2.3.3 and later 

 The   CacheQuickHandler   directive
    controls the phase in which the cache is handled. 

     In the default enabled configuration, the cache operates within the quick
    handler phase. This phase short circuits the majority of server processing,
    and represents the most performant mode of operation for a typical server.
    The cache  bolts onto  the front of the server, and the
    majority of server processing is avoided. 

     When disabled, the cache operates as a normal handler, and is subject to
    the full set of phases when handling a server request. While this mode is
    slower than the default, it allows the cache to be used in cases where full
    processing is required, such as when content is subject to authorisation. 

     # Run cache as a normal handler
CacheQuickHandler off 


     It is also possible, when the quick handler is disabled, for the
    administrator to choose the precise location within the filter chain where
    caching is to be performed, by adding the  CACHE  filter to
    the chain. 

     # Cache content before mod_include and mod_deflate
CacheQuickHandler off
AddOutputFilterByType CACHE;INCLUDES;DEFLATE text/html 


     If the CACHE filter is specified more than once, the last instance will
    apply.
