<LocationMatch>

Description:  Applies the enclosed directives only to regular-expression
matching URLs 
Syntax:   < LocationMatch
     regex  > ... < /LocationMatch >  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 The  < LocationMatch >  directive
    limits the scope of the enclosed directives by URL, in an identical manner
    to   < Location >  . However,
    it takes a  regular expression 
    as an argument instead of a simple string. For example: 

     < LocationMatch "/(extra|special)/data" >
    # ...
< /LocationMatch > 


     would match URLs that contained the substring  /extra/data 
    or  /special/data . 

     From 2.4.8 onwards, named groups and backreferences are captured and
    written to the environment with the corresponding name prefixed with
    "MATCH_" and in upper case. This allows elements of URLs to be referenced
    from within  expressions  and modules like
      mod_rewrite  . In order to prevent confusion, numbered
    (unnamed) backreferences are ignored. Use named groups instead. 

 < LocationMatch ^/combined/(?< sitename >[^/]+) >
    require ldap-group cn=%{env:MATCH_SITENAME},ou=combined,o=Example
< /LocationMatch >
