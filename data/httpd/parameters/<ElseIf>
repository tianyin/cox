<ElseIf>

Description:  Contains directives that apply only if a condition is satisfied
by a request at runtime while the condition of a previous
  < If >   or
 < ElseIf >  section is not
satisfied 
Syntax:   < ElseIf  expression  > ... < /ElseIf >  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  All 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 The  < ElseIf >  applies the enclosed
    directives if and only if both the given condition evaluates to true and
    the most recent  < If >  or
     < ElseIf >  section in the same scope has
    not been applied.  For example: In  

     < If "-R '10.1.0.0/16'" >
  #...
< /If >
< ElseIf "-R '10.0.0.0/8'" >
  #...
< /ElseIf >
< Else >
  #...
< /Else > 


     The  < ElseIf >  would match if
    the remote address of a request belongs to the subnet 10.0.0.0/8 but
    not to the subnet 10.1.0.0/16.
