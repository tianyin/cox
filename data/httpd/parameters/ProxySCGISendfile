ProxySCGISendfile

Description:  Enable evaluation of  X-Sendfile  pseudo response
header 
Syntax:   ProxySCGISendfile On|Off| Headername   
Default:   ProxySCGISendfile Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy_scgi 

 The  ProxySCGISendfile  directive enables the
    SCGI backend to let files be served directly by the gateway. This is useful
    for performance purposes &#8212; httpd can use  sendfile  or other
    optimizations, which are not possible if the file comes over the backend
    socket.  Additionally, the file contents are not transmitted twice. 
     The  ProxySCGISendfile  argument determines the
    gateway behaviour: 
       Off  
     No special handling takes place. 

      On  
     The gateway looks for a backend response header called
     X-Sendfile  and interprets the value as the filename to serve.
    The  header is removed from the final response headers. This is equivalent to
     ProxySCGISendfile X-Sendfile . 

     anything else 
     Similar to  On , but instead of the hardcoded header name
     X-Sendfile , the argument is used as the header name. 
       Example  # Use the default header (X-Sendfile)
ProxySCGISendfile On
    
# Use a different header
ProxySCGISendfile X-Send-Static
