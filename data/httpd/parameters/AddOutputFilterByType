 This directive activates a particular output  filter  for a request depending on the
    response  media-type . 

     The following example uses the  DEFLATE  filter, which
    is provided by   mod_deflate  . It will compress all
    output (either static or dynamic) which is labeled as
     text/html  or  text/plain  before it is sent
    to the client. 

     AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain 


     If you want the content to be processed by more than one filter, their
    names have to be separated by semicolons. It's also possible to use one
     AddOutputFilterByType  directive for each of
    these filters. 

     The configuration below causes all script output labeled as
     text/html  to be processed at first by the
     INCLUDES  filter and then by the  DEFLATE 
    filter.
