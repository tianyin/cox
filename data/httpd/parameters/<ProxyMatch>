<ProxyMatch>

Description:  Container for directives applied to regular-expression-matched
proxied resources 
Syntax:   < ProxyMatch  regex  > ...< /ProxyMatch >  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 

 The  < ProxyMatch >  directive is
    identical to the   < Proxy >   directive, except it matches URLs
    using  regular expressions . 

     From 2.4.8 onwards, named groups and backreferences are captured and
    written to the environment with the corresponding name prefixed with
    "MATCH_" and in upper case. This allows elements of URLs to be referenced
    from within  expressions  and modules like
      mod_rewrite  . In order to prevent confusion, numbered
    (unnamed) backreferences are ignored. Use named groups instead. 

 < ProxyMatch ^http://(?< sitename >[^/]+) >
    Require ldap-group cn=%{env:MATCH_SITENAME},ou=combined,o=Example
< /ProxyMatch >
