StartThreads

Description:  Number of threads created on startup 
Syntax:   StartThreads  number   
Default:   See usage for details  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:    mpm_netware   

 Number of threads created on startup. As the
    number of threads is dynamically controlled depending on the
    load, (see
      MinSpareThreads  ,
      MaxSpareThreads  ,
      MinSpareServers  ,   MaxSpareServers  )
    there is usually little reason to adjust this
    parameter. 

     For   mpm_netware   the default is
     StartThreads 50  and, since there is only a single
    process, this is the total number of threads created at startup to
    serve requests.
