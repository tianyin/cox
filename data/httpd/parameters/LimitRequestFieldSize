LimitRequestFieldSize

Description:  Limits the size of the HTTP request header allowed from the
client 
Syntax:   LimitRequestFieldSize  bytes   
Default:   LimitRequestFieldSize 8190  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 This directive specifies the number of  bytes 
    that will be allowed in an HTTP request header. 

     The  LimitRequestFieldSize  directive
    allows the server administrator to set the limit
    on the allowed size of an HTTP request header field. A server
    needs this value to be large enough to hold any one header field
    from a normal client request. The size of a normal request header
    field will vary greatly among different client implementations,
    often depending upon the extent to which a user has configured
    their browser to support detailed content negotiation. SPNEGO
    authentication headers can be up to 12392 bytes. 

     This directive gives the server administrator greater
    control over abnormal client request behavior, which may be
    useful for avoiding some forms of denial-of-service attacks. 

     For example: 

     LimitRequestFieldSize 4094 


     Under normal conditions, the value should not be changed from
    the default. 

      Warning 
      When name-based virtual hosting is used, the value for this
    directive is taken from the default (first-listed) virtual host best
    matching the current IP address and port combination.
