AuthDigestQop

Description:  Determines the quality-of-protection to use in digest
authentication 
Syntax:   AuthDigestQop none|auth|auth-int [auth|auth-int]  
Default:   AuthDigestQop auth  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_auth_digest 

 The  AuthDigestQop  directive determines
    the  quality-of-protection  to use.  auth  will
    only do authentication (username/password);  auth-int  is
    authentication plus integrity checking (an MD5 hash of the entity
    is also computed and checked);  none  will cause the module
    to use the old RFC-2069 digest algorithm (which does not include
    integrity checking). Both  auth  and  auth-int  may
    be specified, in which the case the browser will choose which of
    these to use.  none  should only be used if the browser for
    some reason does not like the challenge it receives otherwise. 

     
       auth-int  is not implemented yet.
