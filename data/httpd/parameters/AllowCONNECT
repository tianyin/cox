AllowCONNECT

Description:  Ports that are allowed to  CONNECT  through the
proxy 
Syntax:   AllowCONNECT  port [- port ]
[ port [- port ]] ...  
Default:   AllowCONNECT 443 563  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy_connect 
Compatibility:  Moved from   mod_proxy   in Apache 2.3.5.
Port ranges available since Apache 2.3.7. 

 The  AllowCONNECT  directive specifies a list
    of port numbers or ranges to which the proxy  CONNECT  method
    may connect.  Today's browsers use this method when a  https 
    connection is requested and proxy tunneling over HTTP is in effect. 

     By default, only the default https port ( 443 ) and the
    default snews port ( 563 ) are enabled. Use the
     AllowCONNECT  directive to override this default and
    allow connections to the listed ports only.
