AuthFormLoginSuccessLocation

Description:  The URL of the page to be redirected to should login be successful 
Syntax:   AuthFormLoginSuccessLocation  url   
Default:   none  
Context:  directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_auth_form 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.3.0 and later. The use of the expression
parser hass been added in 2.4.4. 

 The   AuthFormLoginSuccessLocation   directive
    specifies the URL to redirect to should the user have logged in successfully. The value is
    parsed using the  ap_expr  parser before being sent to the client.
    This directive can be overridden if a form field has been defined containing another URL
    using the   AuthFormLocation   directive. 

     Use this directive if you have a dedicated login URL, and you have not embedded the
    destination page in the login form.
