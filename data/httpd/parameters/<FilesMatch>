<FilesMatch>

Description:  Contains directives that apply to regular-expression matched
filenames 
Syntax:   < FilesMatch  regex  > ... < /FilesMatch >  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  All 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 The  < FilesMatch >  directive
    limits the scope of the enclosed directives by filename, just as the
      < Files >   directive
    does. However, it accepts a  regular
    expression . For example: 

 < FilesMatch "\.(gif|jpe?g|png)$" >
    # ...
< /FilesMatch > 


     would match most common Internet graphics formats. 

     From 2.4.8 onwards, named groups and backreferences are captured and
    written to the environment with the corresponding name prefixed with
    "MATCH_" and in upper case. This allows elements of files to be referenced
    from within  expressions  and modules like
      mod_rewrite  . In order to prevent confusion, numbered
    (unnamed) backreferences are ignored. Use named groups instead. 

 < FilesMatch ^(?< sitename >[^/]+) >
    require ldap-group cn=%{env:MATCH_SITENAME},ou=combined,o=Example
< /FilesMatch >
