<VirtualHost>

Description:  Contains directives that apply only to a specific
hostname or IP address 
Syntax:   < VirtualHost
     addr [: port ] [ addr [: port ]]
    ... > ... < /VirtualHost >  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

  < VirtualHost >  and
     < /VirtualHost >  are used to enclose a group of
    directives that will apply only to a particular virtual host. Any
    directive that is allowed in a virtual host context may be
    used. When the server receives a request for a document on a
    particular virtual host, it uses the configuration directives
    enclosed in the  < VirtualHost > 
    section.  Addr  can be any of the following, optionally followed by
    a colon and a port number (or *): 

      The IP address of the virtual host; 

       A fully qualified domain name for the IP address of the
      virtual host (not recommended); 

       The character  * , which acts as a wildcard and matches
      any IP address. 

       The string  _default_ , which is an alias for  *  

      < VirtualHost 10.1.2.3:80 >
  ServerAdmin webmaster@host.example.com
  DocumentRoot /www/docs/host.example.com
  ServerName host.example.com
  ErrorLog logs/host.example.com-error_log
  TransferLog logs/host.example.com-access_log
< /VirtualHost > 



     IPv6 addresses must be specified in square brackets because
    the optional port number could not be determined otherwise.  An
    IPv6 example is shown below: 

     < VirtualHost [2001:db8::a00:20ff:fea7:ccea]:80 >
  ServerAdmin webmaster@host.example.com
  DocumentRoot /www/docs/host.example.com
  ServerName host.example.com
  ErrorLog logs/host.example.com-error_log
  TransferLog logs/host.example.com-access_log
< /VirtualHost > 


     Each Virtual Host must correspond to a different IP address,
    different port number or a different host name for the server,
    in the former case the server machine must be configured to
    accept IP packets for multiple addresses. (If the machine does
    not have multiple network interfaces, then this can be
    accomplished with the  ifconfig alias  command -- if
    your OS supports it). 

      Note 
     The use of  < VirtualHost >  does
     not  affect what addresses Apache httpd listens on. You
    may need to ensure that Apache httpd is listening on the correct addresses
    using   Listen  . 
     

     A   ServerName   should be
    specified inside each  < VirtualHost >  block. If it is absent, the
      ServerName   from the "main"
    server configuration will be inherited. 

     When a request is received, the server first maps it to the best matching
     < VirtualHost >  based on the local
    IP address and port combination only.  Non-wildcards have a higher
    precedence. If no match based on IP and port occurs at all, the
    "main" server configuration is used. 

     If multiple virtual hosts contain the best matching IP address and port,
    the server selects from these virtual hosts the best match based on the
    requested hostname.  If no matching name-based virtual host is found,
    then the first listed virtual host that matched the IP address will be
    used.  As a consequence, the first listed virtual host for a given IP address
    and port combination is default virtual host for that IP and port
    combination. 

      Security 
     See the  security tips 
    document for details on why your security could be compromised if the
    directory where log files are stored is writable by anyone other
    than the user that starts the server.
