SSLVerifyClient

Description:  Type of Client Certificate verification 
Syntax:   SSLVerifyClient  level   
Default:   SSLVerifyClient none  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

 
This directive sets the Certificate verification level for the Client
Authentication. Notice that this directive can be used both in per-server and
per-directory context. In per-server context it applies to the client
authentication process used in the standard SSL handshake when a connection is
established. In per-directory context it forces a SSL renegotiation with the
reconfigured client verification level after the HTTP request was read but
before the HTTP response is sent. 
 
The following levels are available for  level : 
   none :
     no client Certificate is required at all 
  optional :
     the client  may  present a valid Certificate 
  require :
     the client  has to  present a valid Certificate 
  optional_no_ca :
     the client may present a valid Certificate 
     but it need not to be (successfully) verifiable. 
  In practice only levels  none  and
 require  are really interesting, because level
 optional  doesn't work with all browsers and level
 optional_no_ca  is actually against the idea of
authentication (but can be used to establish SSL test pages, etc.) 
  Example  SSLVerifyClient require
