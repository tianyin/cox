Description:  Get debug/diagnostic information from

Syntax:   FilterTrace  filter-name   level   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_filter 

 This directive generates debug information from
      mod_filter  .
    It is designed to help test and debug providers (filter modules), although
    it may also help with   mod_filter   itself. 

     The debug output depends on the  level  set: 
       0  (default) 
     No debug information is generated. 

      1  
       mod_filter   will record buckets and brigades
    passing through the filter to the error log, before the provider has
    processed them. This is similar to the information generated by
     mod_diagnostics .
     

      2  (not yet implemented) 
     Will dump the full data passing through to a tempfile before the
    provider.  For single-user debug only ; this will not
    support concurrent hits.
