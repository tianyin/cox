LogLevel

Description:  Controls the verbosity of the ErrorLog 
Syntax:   LogLevel [ module :] level 
    [ module : level ] ...
  
Default:   LogLevel warn  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 
Compatibility:  Per-module and per-directory configuration is available in
    Apache HTTP Server 2.3.6 and later 

  LogLevel  adjusts the verbosity of the
    messages recorded in the error logs (see   ErrorLog   directive). The following
     level s are available, in order of decreasing
    significance: 

        Level

         "cache lookup FAILED, forcing new map lookup" 
          trace7   

         Trace messages, dumping large amounts of data 

         "| 0000: 02 23 44 30 13 40 ac 34 df 3d bf 9a 19 49 39 15 |" 
          trace8   

         Trace messages, dumping large amounts of data 

         "| 0000: 02 23 44 30 13 40 ac 34 df 3d bf 9a 19 49 39 15 |" 
         When a particular level is specified, messages from all
    other levels of higher significance will be reported as well.
     E.g. , when  LogLevel info  is specified,
    then messages with log levels of  notice  and
     warn  will also be posted. 

     Using a level of at least  crit  is
    recommended. 

     For example: 

     LogLevel notice 


      Note 
       When logging to a regular file messages of the level
       notice  cannot be suppressed and thus are always
      logged. However, this doesn't apply when logging is done
      using  syslog . 
     

     Specifying a level without a module name will reset the level
    for all modules to that level.  Specifying a level with a module
    name will set the level for that module only. It is possible to
    use the module source file name, the module identifier, or the
    module identifier with the trailing  _module  omitted
    as module specification. This means the following three specifications
    are equivalent: 

     LogLevel info ssl:warn
LogLevel info mod_ssl.c:warn
LogLevel info ssl_module:warn 


     It is also possible to change the level per directory: 

     LogLevel info
< Directory "/usr/local/apache/htdocs/app" >
  LogLevel debug
< /Directory > 


     
        Per directory loglevel configuration only affects messages that are
	logged after the request has been parsed and that are associated with
	the request. Log messages which are associated with the connection or
	the server are not affected.
