ServerTokens

Description:  Configures the  Server  HTTP response
header 
Syntax:   ServerTokens Major|Minor|Min[imal]|Prod[uctOnly]|OS|Full  
Default:   ServerTokens Full  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 This directive controls whether  Server  response
    header field which is sent back to clients includes a
    description of the generic OS-type of the server as well as
    information about compiled-in modules. 

       ServerTokens Full  (or not specified) 

       Server sends ( e.g. ):  Server: Apache/2.4.2
      (Unix) PHP/4.2.2 MyMod/1.2  

        ServerTokens Prod[uctOnly]  

       Server sends ( e.g. ):  Server:
      Apache  

        ServerTokens Major  

       Server sends ( e.g. ):  Server:
      Apache/2  

        ServerTokens Minor  

       Server sends ( e.g. ):  Server:
      Apache/2.4  

        ServerTokens Min[imal]  

       Server sends ( e.g. ):  Server:
      Apache/2.4.2  

        ServerTokens OS  

       Server sends ( e.g. ):  Server: Apache/2.4.2
      (Unix)  

      This setting applies to the entire server, and cannot be
    enabled or disabled on a virtualhost-by-virtualhost basis. 

     After version 2.0.44, this directive also controls the
    information presented by the   ServerSignature   directive. 

     Setting  ServerTokens  to less than
     minimal  is not recommended because it makes it more
    difficult to debug interoperational problems. Also note that
    disabling the Server: header does nothing at all to make your
    server more secure; the idea of "security through obscurity"
    is a myth and leads to a false sense of safety.
