Protocol

Description:  Protocol for a listening socket 
Syntax:   Protocol  protocol   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache 2.1.5 and later.
On Windows from Apache 2.3.3 and later. 

 This directive specifies the protocol used for a specific listening socket.
       The protocol is used to determine which module should handle a request, and
       to apply protocol specific optimizations with the  AcceptFilter 
       directive. 

     You only need to set the protocol if you are running on non-standard ports, otherwise  http  is assumed for port 80 and  https  for port 443. 

     For example, if you are running  https  on a non-standard port, specify the protocol explicitly: 

     Protocol https 


     You can also specify the protocol using the   Listen   directive.
