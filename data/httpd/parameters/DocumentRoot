DocumentRoot

Description:  Directory that forms the main document tree visible
from the web 
Syntax:   DocumentRoot  directory-path   
Default:   DocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/htdocs  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 This directive sets the directory from which   httpd  
    will serve files. Unless matched by a directive like   Alias  , the server appends the
    path from the requested URL to the document root to make the
    path to the document. Example: 

     DocumentRoot "/usr/web" 


     then an access to
     http://my.example.com/index.html  refers to
     /usr/web/index.html . If the  directory-path  is
    not absolute then it is assumed to be relative to the   ServerRoot  . 

     The  DocumentRoot  should be specified without
    a trailing slash.
