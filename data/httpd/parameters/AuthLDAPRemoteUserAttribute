AuthLDAPRemoteUserAttribute

Description:  Use the value of the attribute returned during the user
query to set the REMOTE_USER environment variable 
Syntax:   AuthLDAPRemoteUserAttribute uid  
Default:   none  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_authnz_ldap 

 If this directive is set, the value of the
     REMOTE_USER  environment variable will be set to the
    value of the attribute specified. Make sure that this attribute is
    included in the list of attributes in the AuthLDAPUrl definition,
    otherwise this directive will have no effect. This directive, if
    present, takes precedence over AuthLDAPRemoteUserIsDN. This
    directive is useful should you want people to log into a website
    using an email address, but a backend application expects the
    username as a userid.
