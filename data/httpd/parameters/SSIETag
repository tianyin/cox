SSIETag

Description:  Controls whether ETags are generated by the server. 
Syntax:   SSIETag on|off  
Default:   SSIETag off  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_include 
Compatibility:  Available in version 2.2.15 and later. 

 Under normal circumstances, a file filtered by   mod_include  
        may contain elements that are either dynamically generated, or that may
        have changed independently of the original file. As a result, by default
        the server is asked not to generate an  ETag  header for the
        response by adding  no-etag  to the request notes. 

       The  SSIETag  directive suppresses this
        behaviour, and allows the server to generate an  ETag  header.
        This can be used to enable caching of the output. Note that a backend server
        or dynamic content generator may generate an ETag of its own, ignoring
         no-etag , and this ETag will be passed by
          mod_include   regardless of the value of this setting.
         SSIETag  can take on the following values: 

         off  
          no-etag  will be added to the request notes, and the server
          is asked not to generate an ETag. Where a server ignores the value of
           no-etag  and generates an ETag anyway, the ETag will be
          respected. 

          on  
         Existing ETags will be respected, and ETags generated by the server will
          be passed on in the response.
