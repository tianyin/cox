 This directive controls the format of the cookie header
    field. The three formats allowed are: 

       Netscape , which is the original but now deprecated
      syntax. This is the default, and the syntax Apache has
      historically used. 

        Cookie  or  RFC2109 , which is the syntax that
      superseded the Netscape syntax. 

        Cookie2  or  RFC2965 , which is the most
      current cookie syntax. 
      Not all clients can understand all of these formats, but you
    should use the newest one that is generally acceptable to your
    users' browsers. At the time of writing, most browsers support all
    three of these formats, with  Cookie2  being the
    preferred format.
