MaxSpareThreads

Description:  Maximum number of idle threads 
Syntax:   MaxSpareThreads  number   
Default:   See usage for details  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:    event  ,   mpm_netware  ,   mpmt_os2  ,   worker   

 Maximum number of idle threads. Different MPMs deal with this
    directive differently. 

     For   worker  , the default is
     MaxSpareThreads 250 . This MPM deals with idle threads
    on a server-wide basis. If there are too many idle threads in the
    server then child processes are killed until the number of idle
    threads is less than this number. 

     For   mpm_netware   the default is
     MaxSpareThreads 100 . Since this MPM runs a
    single-process, the spare thread count is also server-wide. 

       mpmt_os2   works
    similar to   mpm_netware  . For
      mpmt_os2   the default value is  10 . 

      Restrictions 
       The range of the  MaxSpareThreads  value
      is restricted. Apache httpd will correct the given value automatically
      according to the following rules: 
          mpm_netware   wants the value to be greater than
          MinSpareThreads  . 

         For   worker  , the value must be greater or equal
        to the sum of   MinSpareThreads  
        and   ThreadsPerChild  .
