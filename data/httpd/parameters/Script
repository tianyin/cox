Script

Description:  Activates a CGI script for a particular request
method. 
Syntax:   Script  method   cgi-script   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_actions 

 This directive adds an action, which will activate
     cgi-script  when a file is requested using the method of
     method . The  cgi-script  is the URL-path to a
    resource that has been designated as a CGI script using   ScriptAlias   or   AddHandler  .  The URL and
    file path of the requested document is sent using the standard CGI
     PATH_INFO  and  PATH_TRANSLATED  environment
    variables. 

     
      Any arbitrary method name may be used.  Method names are
      case-sensitive , so  Script PUT  and
       Script put  have two entirely different
      effects.
     

     Note that the  Script  command defines default
    actions only. If a CGI script is called, or some other resource that is
    capable of handling the requested method internally, it will do
    so. Also note that  Script  with a method of
     GET  will only be called if there are query arguments present
    ( e.g. , foo.html?hi). Otherwise, the request will
    proceed normally. 

     # All GET requests go here
Script GET /cgi-bin/search

# A CGI PUT handler
Script PUT /~bob/put.cgi
