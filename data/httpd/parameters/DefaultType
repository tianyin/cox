DefaultType

Description:  This directive has no effect other than to emit warnings
if the value is not  none . In prior versions, DefaultType
would specify a default media type to assign to response content for
which no other media type configuration could be found.
 
Syntax:   DefaultType  media-type|none   
Default:   DefaultType none  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 
Compatibility:  The argument  none  is available in Apache httpd 2.2.7 and later.  All other choices are DISABLED for 2.3.x and later. 

 This directive has been disabled.  For backwards compatibility
    of configuration files, it may be specified with the value
     none , meaning no default media type. For example: 

     DefaultType None 


      DefaultType None  is only available in
    httpd-2.2.7 and later. 

     Use the mime.types configuration file and the
      AddType   to configure media
    type assignments via file extensions, or the
      ForceType   directive to configure
    the media type for specific resources. Otherwise, the server will
    send the response without a Content-Type header field and the
    recipient may attempt to guess the media type.
