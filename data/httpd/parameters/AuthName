AuthName

Description:  Authorization realm for use in HTTP
authentication 
Syntax:   AuthName  auth-domain   
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_authn_core 

 This directive sets the name of the authorization realm for a
    directory. This realm is given to the client so that the user
    knows which username and password to send.
     AuthName  takes a single argument; if the
    realm name contains spaces, it must be enclosed in quotation
    marks.  It must be accompanied by   AuthType   and   Require   directives, and directives such
    as   AuthUserFile   and
      AuthGroupFile   to
    work. 

    For example: 

    AuthName "Top Secret" 


     The string provided for the  AuthName  is what will
    appear in the password dialog provided by most browsers.
