SessionCryptoPassphrase

Description:  The key used to encrypt the session 
Syntax:   SessionCryptoPassphrase  secret  [  secret  ... ]   
Default:   none  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Experimental 
Module:  mod_session_crypto 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache 2.3.0 and later 

 The  SessionCryptoPassphrase  directive specifies the keys
    to be used to enable symmetrical encryption on the contents of the session before
    writing the session, or decrypting the contents of the session after reading the
    session. 

     Keys are more secure when they are long, and consist of truly random characters.
    Changing the key on a server has the effect of invalidating all existing sessions. 

     Multiple keys can be specified in order to support key rotation. The first key
    listed will be used for encryption, while all keys listed will be attempted for
    decryption. To rotate keys across multiple servers over a period of time, add a new
    secret to the end of the list, and once rolled out completely to all servers, remove
    the first key from the start of the list. 

     As of version 2.4.7 if the value begins with  exec:  the resulting command
    will be executed and the first line returned to standard output by the program will be
    used as the key. 
  #key used as-is
