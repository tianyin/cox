CacheDetailHeader

Description:  Add an X-Cache-Detail header to the response. 
Syntax:   CacheDetailHeader  on|off   
Default:   CacheDetailHeader off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache 2.3.9 and later 

 When the   CacheDetailHeader   directive
  is switched on, an  X-Cache-Detail  header will be added to the response
  containing the detailed reason for a particular caching decision. 

   It can be useful during development of cached RESTful services to have additional
  information about the caching decision written to the response headers, so as to
  confirm whether  Cache-Control  and other headers have been correctly
  used by the service and client. 

   If the normal handler is used, this directive may appear within a
    < Directory >   or
    < Location >   directive. If the quick handler
  is used, this directive must appear within a server or virtual host context, otherwise
  the setting will be ignored. 

   # Enable the X-Cache-Detail header
CacheDetailHeader on 


     
    X-Cache-Detail: "conditional cache hit: entity refreshed" from localhost
