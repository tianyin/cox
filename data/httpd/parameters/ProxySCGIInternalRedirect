ProxySCGIInternalRedirect

Description:  Enable or disable internal redirect responses from the
backend 
Syntax:   ProxySCGIInternalRedirect On|Off  
Default:   ProxySCGIInternalRedirect On  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy_scgi 

 The  ProxySCGIInternalRedirect  enables the backend
    to internally redirect the gateway to a different URL. This feature
    originates in   mod_cgi  , which internally redirects the
    response if the response status is  OK  ( 200 ) and
    the response contains a  Location  header and its value starts
    with a slash ( / ). This value is interpreted as a new local
    URL that Apache httpd internally redirects to. 

       mod_proxy_scgi   does the same as
      mod_cgi   in this regard, except that you can turn off the
    feature.
