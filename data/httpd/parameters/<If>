<If>

Description:  Contains directives that apply only if a condition is
satisfied by a request at runtime 
Syntax:   < If  expression  > ... < /If >  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  All 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 The  < If >  directive
    evaluates an expression at runtime, and applies the enclosed
    directives if and only if the expression evaluates to true.
    For example: 

     < If "-z req('Host')" > 


     would match HTTP/1.0 requests without a  Host:  header.
    Expressions may contain various shell-like operators for string
    comparison ( == ,  != ,  <  , ...),
    integer comparison ( -eq ,  -ne , ...),
    and others ( -n ,  -z ,  -f , ...).
    It is also possible to use regular expressions,  

     < If "%{QUERY_STRING} =~ /(delete|commit)=.*?elem/" > 


     shell-like pattern matches and many other operations. These operations
    can be done on request headers ( req ), environment variables
    ( env ), and a large number of other properties. The full
    documentation is available in  Expressions in
    Apache HTTP Server . 

     Only directives that support the  directory context  can be used within this configuration section.

    < Files > sections work  for an explanation of how these
    different sections are combined when a request is received.
     < If > ,
     < ElseIf > , and
     < Else >  are applied last.
