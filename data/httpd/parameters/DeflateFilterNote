DeflateFilterNote

Description:  Places the compression ratio in a note for logging 
Syntax:   DeflateFilterNote [ type ]  notename   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_deflate 

 The  DeflateFilterNote  directive
    specifies that a note about compression ratios should be attached
    to the request. The name of the note is the value specified for
    the directive. You can use that note for statistical purposes by
    adding the value to your  access log . 

      Example        DeflateFilterNote ratio
    
      LogFormat '"%r" %b (%{ratio}n) "%{User-agent}i"' deflate
      CustomLog logs/deflate_log deflate 
 

     If you want to extract more accurate values from your logs, you
    can use the  type  argument to specify the type of data
    left as note for logging.  type  can be one of: 

       Input  
       Store the byte count of the filter's input stream in the note. 

        Output  
       Store the byte count of the filter's output stream in the note. 

        Ratio  
       Store the compression ratio ( output/input * 100 )
      in the note. This is the default, if the  type  argument
      is omitted. 
      Thus you may log it this way: 

      Accurate Logging  DeflateFilterNote Input instream
DeflateFilterNote Output outstream
DeflateFilterNote Ratio ratio

LogFormat '"%r" %{outstream}n/%{instream}n (%{ratio}n%%)' deflate
CustomLog logs/deflate_log deflate
