SSLCertificateChainFile

Description:  File of PEM-encoded Server CA Certificates 
Syntax:   SSLCertificateChainFile  file-path   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

  SSLCertificateChainFile  became obsolete with version 2.4.8,
when   SSLCertificateFile  
was extended to also load intermediate CA certificates from the server
certificate file. 
 

 
This directive sets the optional  all-in-one  file where you can
assemble the certificates of Certification Authorities (CA) which form the
certificate chain of the server certificate. This starts with the issuing CA
certificate of the server certificate and can range up to the root CA
certificate. Such a file is simply the concatenation of the various
PEM-encoded CA Certificate files, usually in certificate chain order. 
 
This should be used alternatively and/or additionally to   SSLCACertificatePath   for explicitly
constructing the server certificate chain which is sent to the browser
in addition to the server certificate. It is especially useful to
avoid conflicts with CA certificates when using client
authentication. Because although placing a CA certificate of the
server certificate chain into   SSLCACertificatePath   has the same effect
for the certificate chain construction, it has the side-effect that
client certificates issued by this same CA certificate are also
accepted on client authentication. 
 
But be careful: Providing the certificate chain works only if you are using a
 single  RSA  or  DSA based server certificate. If you are
using a coupled RSA+DSA certificate pair, this will work only if actually both
certificates use the  same  certificate chain. Else the browsers will be
confused in this situation. 
  Example  SSLCertificateChainFile /usr/local/apache2/conf/ssl.crt/ca.crt
