VHostPrivs

Description:  Assign arbitrary privileges to a virtual host. 
Syntax:   VHostPrivs [+-]? privilege-name  [[+-]?privilege-name] ...  
Default:   None  
Context:  virtual host 
Status:  Experimental 
Module:  mod_privileges 
Compatibility:  Available on Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris with
non-threaded MPMs (  prefork   or custom MPM)
and when   mod_privileges   is compiled with the
 BIG_SECURITY_HOLE  compile-time option. 

  VHostPrivs  can be used to assign arbitrary  privileges  to a virtual host.  Each  privilege-name 
    is the name of a Solaris privilege, such as  file_setid 
    or  sys_nfs . 

     A  privilege-name  may optionally be prefixed by
    + or -, which will respectively allow or deny a privilege.
    If used with neither + nor -, all privileges otherwise assigned
    to the virtualhost will be denied.  You can use this to override
    any of the default sets and construct your own privilege set. 

      Security 
     This directive can open huge security holes in apache, up to
    and including running requests with root-level powers.  Do not
    use it unless you fully understand what you are doing!
