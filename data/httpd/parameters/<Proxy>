<Proxy>

Description:  Container for directives applied to proxied resources 
Syntax:   < Proxy  wildcard-url  > ...< /Proxy >  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 

 Directives placed in  < Proxy > 
    sections apply only to matching proxied content.  Shell-style wildcards are
    allowed. 

     For example, the following will allow only hosts in
     yournetwork.example.com  to access content via your proxy
    server: 

     < Proxy * >
  Require host yournetwork.example.com
< /Proxy > 


     The following example will process all files in the  foo 
    directory of  example.com  through the  INCLUDES 
    filter when they are sent through the proxy server: 

    < Proxy http://example.com/foo/* >
  SetOutputFilter INCLUDES
< /Proxy > 


      Differences from the Location configuration section 
       A backend URL matches the configuration section if it begins with the 
      the  wildcard-url  string, even if the last path segment in the
      directive only matches a prefix of the backend URL.  For example, 
      < Proxy http://example.com/foo > matches all of 
      http://example.com/foo, http://example.com/foo/bar, and 
      http://example.com/foobar.  The matching of the final URL differs
      from the behavior of the   < Location >   section, which for purposes of this note 
      treats the final path component as if it ended in a slash.
