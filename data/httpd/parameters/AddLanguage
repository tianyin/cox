AddLanguage

Description:  Maps the given filename extension to the specified content
language 
Syntax:   AddLanguage  language-tag   extension 
[ extension ] ...  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_mime 

 The  AddLanguage  directive maps the given
    filename extension to the specified content language.  Files with the
    filename  extension  are assigned an HTTP Content-Language
    value of  language-tag  corresponding to the language
    identifiers defined by RFC 3066.
    This directive overrides any mappings that already exist for the same
     extension . 

      Example  AddEncoding x-compress .Z
AddLanguage en .en
AddLanguage fr .fr 
 

     Then the document  xxxx.en.Z  will be treated as
    being a compressed English document (as will the document
     xxxx.Z.en ). Although the content language is
    reported to the client, the browser is unlikely to use this
    information. The  AddLanguage  directive is
    more useful for  content
    negotiation , where the server returns one from several documents
    based on the client's language preference. 

     If multiple language assignments are made for the same
    extension, the last one encountered is the one that is used.
    That is, for the case of: 

     AddLanguage en .en
AddLanguage en-gb .en
AddLanguage en-us .en 


     documents with the extension  .en  would be treated as
    being  en-us . 

     The  extension  argument is case-insensitive and can
    be specified with or without a leading dot. Filenames may have  multiple extensions  and the
     extension  argument will be compared against each of
    them.
