PrivilegesMode

Description:  Trade off processing speed and efficiency vs security against
malicious privileges-aware code. 
Syntax:   PrivilegesMode FAST|SECURE|SELECTIVE  
Default:   PrivilegesMode FAST  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Experimental 
Module:  mod_privileges 
Compatibility:  Available on Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris with
non-threaded MPMs (  prefork   or custom MPM). 

 This directive trades off performance vs security against
malicious, privileges-aware code.  In  SECURE  mode, each request
runs in a secure subprocess, incurring a substantial performance penalty.
In  FAST  mode, the server is not protected against escalation
of privileges as discussed above. 
 This directive differs slightly between a  < Directory > 
	context (including equivalents such as Location/Files/If) and a
	top-level or  < VirtualHost > . 
 At top-level, it sets a default that will be inherited by virtualhosts.
	In a virtual host, FAST or SECURE mode acts on the entire
	HTTP request, and any settings in a  < Directory > 
	context will be  ignored .  A third pseudo-mode
	SELECTIVE defers the choice of FAST vs SECURE to directives in a
	 < Directory >  context. 
 In a  < Directory >  context, it is applicable only
	where SELECTIVE mode was set for the VirtualHost.  Only
	FAST or SECURE can be set in this context (SELECTIVE would be
meaningless). 
  Warning 
	Where SELECTIVE mode is selected for a virtual host, the activation
	of privileges must be deferred until  after  the mapping
	phase of request processing has determined what
	 < Directory >  context applies to the request.
	This might give an attacker opportunities to introduce
	code through a   RewriteMap  
	running at top-level or  < VirtualHost >  context
	 before  privileges have been dropped and userid/gid set.
