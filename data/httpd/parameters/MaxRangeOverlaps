 The  MaxRangeOverlaps  directive
            limits the number of overlapping HTTP ranges the server is willing to
            return to the client. If more overlapping ranges than permitted are requested,
            the complete resource is returned instead. 

           default  
             Limits the number of overlapping ranges to a compile-time default of 20. 

              none  
             No overlapping Range headers are allowed. 

              unlimited  
             The server does not limit the number of overlapping ranges it is
                willing to satisfy. 

              number-of-ranges  
             A positive number representing the maximum number of overlapping ranges the
                server is willing to satisfy.
