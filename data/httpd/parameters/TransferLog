TransferLog

Description:  Specify location of a log file 
Syntax:   TransferLog  file | pipe   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_log_config 

 This directive has exactly the same arguments and effect as
    the   CustomLog  
    directive, with the exception that it does not allow the log format
    to be specified explicitly or for conditional logging of requests.
    Instead, the log format is determined by the most recently specified
      LogFormat   directive
    which does not define a nickname. Common Log Format is used if no
    other format has been specified. 

      Example  LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" % >s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\""
TransferLog logs/access_log
