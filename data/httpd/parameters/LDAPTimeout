LDAPTimeout

Description:  Specifies the timeout for LDAP search and bind operations, in seconds 
Syntax:   LDAPTimeout  seconds   
Default:   LDAPTimeout 60  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ldap 
Compatibility:  Apache HTTP Server 2.3.5 and later 

 This directive configures the timeout for bind and search operations, as well as
    the LDAP_OPT_TIMEOUT option in the underlying LDAP client library, when available. 

      If the timeout expires, httpd will retry in case an existing connection has
    been silently dropped by a firewall. However, performance will be much better if
    the firewall is configured to send TCP RST packets instead of silently dropping
    packets. 

     
     Timeouts for ldap compare operations requires an SDK with LDAP_OPT_TIMEOUT, such as OpenLDAP  >= 2.4.4.
