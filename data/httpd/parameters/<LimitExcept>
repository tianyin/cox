<LimitExcept>

Description:  Restrict access controls to all HTTP methods
except the named ones 
Syntax:   < LimitExcept  method  [ method ] ...  > ...
    < /LimitExcept >  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig, Limit 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

  < LimitExcept >  and
     < /LimitExcept >  are used to enclose
    a group of access control directives which will then apply to any
    HTTP access method  not  listed in the arguments;
    i.e., it is the opposite of a   < Limit >   section and can be used to control
    both standard and nonstandard/unrecognized methods. See the
    documentation for   < Limit >   for more details. 

     For example: 

     < LimitExcept POST GET >
  Require valid-user
< /LimitExcept >
