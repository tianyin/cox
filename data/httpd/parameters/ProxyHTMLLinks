ProxyHTMLLinks

Description:  Specify HTML elements that have URL attributes to be rewritten. 
Syntax:   ProxyHTMLLinks  element attribute [attribute2 ...]   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_proxy_html 
Compatibility:  Version 2.4 and later; available as a third-party
for earlier 2.x versions 

 Specifies elements that have URL attributes that should be rewritten
using standard  ProxyHTMLURLMap s.  You will need one
ProxyHTMLLinks directive per element, but it can have any number of attributes. 
 Normally you'll set this globally.  If you set ProxyHTMLLinks in more than
one scope so that one overrides the other, you'll need to specify a complete
set in each of those scopes. 
 A default configuration is supplied in  proxy-html.conf 
and defines the HTML links for standard HTML 4 and XHTML 1.
