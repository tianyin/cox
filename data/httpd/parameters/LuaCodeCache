LuaCodeCache

Description:  Configure the compiled code cache. 
Syntax:   LuaCodeCache stat|forever|never

Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  All 
Status:  Experimental 
Module:  mod_lua 

 
    Specify the behavior of the in-memory code cache. The default
    is stat, which stats the top level script (not any included
    ones) each time that file is needed, and reloads it if the
    modified time indicates it is newer than the one it has
    already loaded. The other values cause it to keep the file
    cached forever (don't stat and replace) or to never cache the
    file. 

     In general stat or forever is good for production, and stat or never
    for development. 

      Examples:  LuaCodeCache stat
LuaCodeCache forever
LuaCodeCache never
