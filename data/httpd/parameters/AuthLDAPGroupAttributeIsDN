Default:   AuthLDAPGroupAttributeIsDN on  
Context:  directory, .htaccess

 When set  on , this directive says to use the
    distinguished name of the client username when checking for group
    membership.  Otherwise, the username will be used. For example,
    assume that the client sent the username  bjenson ,
    which corresponds to the LDAP DN  cn=Babs Jenson,
    o=Example . If this directive is set,
      mod_authnz_ldap   will check if the group has
     cn=Babs Jenson, o=Example  as a member. If this
    directive is not set, then   mod_authnz_ldap   will
    check if the group has  bjenson  as a member.
