UserDir

Description:  Location of the user-specific directories 
Syntax:   UserDir  directory-filename  [ directory-filename ] ...
  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_userdir 

 The  UserDir  directive sets the real
    directory in a user's home directory to use when a request for a
    document for a user is received.  Directory-filename  is
    one of the following: 

      The name of a directory or a pattern such as those shown
      below. 

       The keyword  disabled . This turns off
       all  username-to-directory translations except those
      explicitly named with the  enabled  keyword (see
      below). 

       The keyword  disabled  followed by a
      space-delimited list of usernames. Usernames that appear in
      such a list will  never  have directory translation
      performed, even if they appear in an  enabled 
      clause. 

       The keyword  enabled  followed by a
      space-delimited list of usernames. These usernames will have
      directory translation performed even if a global disable is
      in effect, but not if they also appear in a
       disabled  clause. 
      If neither the  enabled  nor the
     disabled  keywords appear in the
     Userdir  directive, the argument is treated as a
    filename pattern, and is used to turn the name into a directory
    specification. A request for
     http://www.example.com/~bob/one/two.html  will be
    translated to: 

       UserDir directive used 
           Translated path    UserDir public_html 
           ~bob/public_html/one/two.html    UserDir /usr/web 
           /usr/web/bob/one/two.html    UserDir /home/*/www 
           /home/bob/www/one/two.html    The following directives will send redirects to the client: 

       UserDir directive used 
           Translated path    UserDir http://www.example.com/users 
           http://www.example.com/users/bob/one/two.html    UserDir http://www.example.com/*/usr 
           http://www.example.com/bob/usr/one/two.html    UserDir http://www.example.com/~*/ 
           http://www.example.com/~bob/one/two.html    
       Be careful when using this directive; for instance,
       "UserDir ./"  would map  "/~root"  to
       "/"  - which is probably undesirable. It is strongly
      recommended that your configuration include a " UserDir
      disabled root " declaration.  See also the   Directory   directive and the  Security Tips  page for
      more information. 
     

     Additional examples: 

     To allow a few users to have  UserDir  directories, but
    not anyone else, use the following: 

     UserDir disabled
UserDir enabled user1 user2 user3 


     To allow most users to have  UserDir  directories, but
    deny this to a few, use the following: 

     UserDir disabled user4 user5 user6 


     It is also possible to specify alternative user directories.
    If you use a command like: 

     UserDir public_html /usr/web http://www.example.com/ 


     With a request for
     http://www.example.com/~bob/one/two.html , will try to
    find the page at  ~bob/public_html/one/two.html  first, then
     /usr/web/bob/one/two.html , and finally it will send a
    redirect to  http://www.example.com/bob/one/two.html . 

     If you add a redirect, it must be the last alternative in the list.
    Apache httpd cannot determine if the redirect succeeded or not, so if you have
    the redirect earlier in the list, that will always be the alternative
    that is used. 

     User directory substitution is not active by default in versions
    2.1.4 and later.  In earlier versions,  UserDir public_html 
    was assumed if no   UserDir  
    directive was present. 

      Merging details 
      Lists of specific enabled and disabled users are replaced, not merged,
    from global to virtual host scope
