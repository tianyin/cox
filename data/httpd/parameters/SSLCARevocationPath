Client Auth 
Syntax:   SSLCARevocationPath  directory-path   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

 
This directive sets the directory where you keep the Certificate Revocation
Lists (CRL) of Certification Authorities (CAs) whose clients you deal with.
These are used to revoke the client certificate on Client Authentication. 
 
The files in this directory have to be PEM-encoded and are accessed through
hash filenames. So usually you have not only to place the CRL files there.
Additionally you have to create symbolic links named
 hash-value  .rN . And you should always make sure this directory
contains the appropriate symbolic links. 
  Example  SSLCARevocationPath /usr/local/apache2/conf/ssl.crl/
