RewriteBase

Description:  Sets the base URL for per-directory rewrites 
Syntax:   RewriteBase  URL-path   
Default:   None  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_rewrite 

 The  RewriteBase  directive specifies the
      URL prefix to be used for per-directory (htaccess) 
       RewriteRule  directives that substitute a relative
      path. 
        This directive is  required  when you use a relative path
      in a substitution in per-directory (htaccess) context unless either
      of the following conditions are true: 
         The original request, and the substitution, are underneath the 
                 DocumentRoot  
               (as opposed to reachable by other means, such as 
                 Alias  ). 
            The  filesystem  path to the directory containing the
                RewriteRule , suffixed by the relative 
               substitution is also valid as a URL path on the server 
               (this is rare). 
         In the example below,  RewriteBase  is necessary
    to avoid rewriting to http://example.com/opt/myapp-1.2.3/welcome.html
    since the resource was not relative to the document root.  This 
    misconfiguration would normally cause the server to look for an "opt"
    directory under the document root. 
 DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com
Alias /myapp /opt/myapp-1.2.3
< Directory /opt/myapp-1.2.3 >
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /myapp/
    RewriteRule ^index\.html$  welcome.html 
< /Directory >
