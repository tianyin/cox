ProxyBlock

Description:  Words, hosts, or domains that are banned from being
proxied 
Syntax:   ProxyBlock *| word | host | domain 
[ word | host | domain ] ...  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 

 The  ProxyBlock  directive specifies a list of
    words, hosts and/or domains, separated by spaces.  HTTP, HTTPS, and
    FTP document requests to sites whose names contain matched words,
    hosts or domains are  blocked  by the proxy server. The proxy
    module will also attempt to determine IP addresses of list items which
    may be hostnames during startup, and cache them for match test as
    well. That may slow down the startup time of the server. 

      Example  ProxyBlock news.example.com auctions.example.com friends.example.com 
 

     Note that  example  would also be sufficient to match any
    of these sites. 

     Hosts would also be matched if referenced by IP address. 

     Note also that 

     ProxyBlock * 


     blocks connections to all sites.
