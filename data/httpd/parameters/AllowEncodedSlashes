AllowEncodedSlashes

Description:  Determines whether encoded path separators in URLs are allowed to
be passed through 
Syntax:   AllowEncodedSlashes On|Off|NoDecode  
Default:   AllowEncodedSlashes Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 
Compatibility:  
NoDecode option available in 2.3.12 and later. 

 The  AllowEncodedSlashes  directive allows URLs
    which contain encoded path separators ( %2F  for  / 
    and additionally  %5C  for  \  on according systems)
    to be used in the path info. 

     With the default value,  Off , such URLs are refused
    with a 404 (Not found) error. 

     With the value  On , such URLs are accepted, and encoded
      slashes are decoded like all other encoded characters. 

     With the value  NoDecode , such URLs are accepted, but
      encoded slashes are not decoded but left in their encoded state. 

     Turning  AllowEncodedSlashes   On  is
    mostly useful when used in conjunction with  PATH_INFO . 

      Note 
       If encoded slashes are needed in path info, use of  NoDecode  is
      strongly recommended as a security measure.  Allowing slashes
      to be decoded could potentially allow unsafe paths.
