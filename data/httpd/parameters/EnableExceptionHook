EnableExceptionHook

Description:  Enables a hook that runs exception handlers
after a crash 
Syntax:   EnableExceptionHook On|Off  
Default:   EnableExceptionHook Off  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:    event  ,   prefork  ,   worker   

 For safety reasons this directive is only available if the server was
    configured with the  --enable-exception-hook  option. It
    enables a hook that allows external modules to plug in and do something
    after a child crashed. 

     There are already two modules,  mod_whatkilledus  and
     mod_backtrace  that make use of this hook. Please have a
    look at Jeff Trawick's  EnableExceptionHook site  for more information about these.
