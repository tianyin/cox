SessionExclude

Description:  Define URL prefixes for which a session is ignored 
Syntax:   SessionExclude  path   
Default:   none  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_session 

 The  SessionExclude  directive allows sessions to
    be disabled relative to URL prefixes only. This can be used to make a
    website more efficient, by targeting a more precise URL space for which
    a session should be maintained. By default, all URLs within the directory
    or location are included in the session. The
      SessionExclude   directive takes
    precedence over the
      SessionInclude   directive. 

      Warning 
     This directive has a similar purpose to the  path  attribute
    in HTTP cookies, but should not be confused with this attribute. This
    directive does not set the  path  attribute, which must be
    configured separately.
