AliasMatch

Description:  Maps URLs to filesystem locations using regular
expressions 
Syntax:   AliasMatch  regex 
 file-path | directory-path   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_alias 

 This directive is equivalent to   Alias  , but makes use of
     regular expressions ,
    instead of simple prefix matching. The
    supplied regular expression is matched against the URL-path, and
    if it matches, the server will substitute any parenthesized
    matches into the given string and use it as a filename. For
    example, to activate the  /icons  directory, one might
    use: 

     AliasMatch ^/icons(.*) /usr/local/apache/icons$1 


     The full range of  regular expression 
    power is available.  For example,
    it is possible to construct an alias with case-insensitive
    matching of the URL-path: 

     AliasMatch (?i)^/image(.*) /ftp/pub/image$1 


     One subtle difference
    between   Alias  
    and   AliasMatch   is
    that   Alias   will
    automatically copy any additional part of the URI, past the part
    that matched, onto the end of the file path on the right side,
    while   AliasMatch   will
    not.  This means that in almost all cases, you will want the
    regular expression to match the entire request URI from beginning
    to end, and to use substitution on the right side. 

     In other words, just changing
      Alias   to
      AliasMatch   will not
    have the same effect.  At a minimum, you need to
    add  ^  to the beginning of the regular expression
    and add  (.*)$  to the end, and add  $1  to
    the end of the replacement. 

     For example, suppose you want to replace this with AliasMatch: 

     Alias /image/ /ftp/pub/image/ 


     This is NOT equivalent - don't do this!  This will send all
    requests that have /image/ anywhere in them to /ftp/pub/image/: 

     AliasMatch /image/ /ftp/pub/image/ 


     This is what you need to get the same effect: 

     AliasMatch ^/image/(.*)$ /ftp/pub/image/$1 


     Of course, there's no point in
    using   AliasMatch  
    where   Alias   would
    work.    AliasMatch   lets
    you do more complicated things.  For example, you could
    serve different kinds of files from different directories: 

           AliasMatch ^/image/(.*)\.jpg$ /files/jpg.images/$1.jpg 
      AliasMatch ^/image/(.*)\.gif$ /files/gif.images/$1.gif 


     Multiple leading slashes in the requested URL are discarded
       by the server before directives from this module compares
       against the requested URL-path.
