AccessFileName

Description:  Name of the distributed configuration file 
Syntax:   AccessFileName  filename  [ filename ] ...  
Default:   AccessFileName .htaccess  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 While processing a request the server looks for
    the first existing configuration file from this list of names in
    every directory of the path to the document, if distributed
    configuration files are  enabled for that
    directory . For example: 

     AccessFileName .acl 


     before returning the document
     /usr/local/web/index.html , the server will read
     /.acl ,  /usr/.acl ,
     /usr/local/.acl  and  /usr/local/web/.acl 
    for directives, unless they have been disabled with 

     < Directory / >
    AllowOverride None
< /Directory >
