EnableMMAP

Description:  Use memory-mapping to read files during delivery 
Syntax:   EnableMMAP On|Off  
Default:   EnableMMAP On  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 This directive controls whether the   httpd   may use
    memory-mapping if it needs to read the contents of a file during
    delivery.  By default, when the handling of a request requires
    access to the data within a file -- for example, when delivering a
    server-parsed file using   mod_include   -- Apache httpd
    memory-maps the file if the OS supports it. 

     This memory-mapping sometimes yields a performance improvement.
    But in some environments, it is better to disable the memory-mapping
    to prevent operational problems: 

      On some multiprocessor systems, memory-mapping can reduce the
    performance of the   httpd  . 
     Deleting or truncating a file while   httpd  
      has it memory-mapped can cause   httpd   to
      crash with a segmentation fault.
     
      For server configurations that are vulnerable to these problems,
    you should disable memory-mapping of delivered files by specifying: 

     EnableMMAP Off 


     For NFS mounted files, this feature may be disabled explicitly for
    the offending files by specifying: 

     < Directory "/path-to-nfs-files" >
  EnableMMAP Off
< /Directory >
