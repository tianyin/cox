RewriteOptions

Description:  Sets some special options for the rewrite engine 
Syntax:   RewriteOptions  Options   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_rewrite 
Compatibility:   MaxRedirects  is no longer available in version 2.1 and
later 

 The  RewriteOptions  directive sets some
      special options for the current per-server or per-directory
      configuration. The  Option  string can currently
      only be one of the following: 

         Inherit  
       

       This forces the current configuration to inherit the
      configuration of the parent. In per-virtual-server context,
      this means that the maps, conditions and rules of the main
      server are inherited. In per-directory context this means
      that conditions and rules of the parent directory's
       .htaccess  configuration or
        < Directory >  
      sections are inherited. The inherited rules are virtually copied
      to the section where this directive is being used. If used in
      combination with local rules, the inherited rules are copied behind
      the local rules. The position of this directive - below or above
      of local rules - has no influence on this behavior. If local
      rules forced the rewriting to stop, the inherited rules won't
      be processed. 

       
      Rules inherited from the parent scope are applied
       after  rules specified in the child scope.
       
       

        InheritBefore  
       
        Like  Inherit  above, but the rules from the parent scope
      are applied  before  rules specified in the child scope. 
      Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.3.10 and later. 
       

        InheritDown  
       

       If this option is enabled, all child configurations will inherit
      the configuration of the current configuration. It is equivalent to
      specifying  RewriteOptions Inherit  in all child
      configurations. See the  Inherit  option for more details
      on how the parent-child relationships are handled. 
      Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.8 and later. 
       

        InheritDownBefore  
       

       Like  InheritDown  above, but the rules from the current
      scope are applied  before  rules specified in any child's
      scope. 
      Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.8 and later. 
       

        IgnoreInherit  
       

       This option forces the current and child configurations to ignore
      all rules that would be inherited from a parent specifying
       InheritDown  or  InheritDownBefore . 
      Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.8 and later. 
       

        AllowNoSlash  
       
       By default,   mod_rewrite   will ignore URLs that map to a
      directory on disk but lack a trailing slash, in the expectation that
      the   mod_dir   module will issue the client with a redirect to
      the canonical URL with a trailing slash. 
      
       When the   DirectorySlash   directive
      is set to off, the  AllowNoSlash  option can be enabled to ensure
      that rewrite rules are no longer ignored. This option makes it possible to
      apply rewrite rules within .htaccess files that match the directory without
      a trailing slash, if so desired. 
      Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0 and later. 
       

        AllowAnyURI  
       

       When   RewriteRule  
      is used in  VirtualHost  or server context with
      version 2.2.22 or later of httpd,   mod_rewrite  
      will only process the rewrite rules if the request URI is a  URL-path .  This avoids
      some security issues where particular rules could allow
      "surprising" pattern expansions (see  CVE-2011-3368 
      and  CVE-2011-4317 ).
      To lift the restriction on matching a URL-path, the
       AllowAnyURI  option can be enabled, and
        mod_rewrite   will apply the rule set to any
      request URI string, regardless of whether that string matches
      the URL-path grammar required by the HTTP specification. 
      Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.3 and later. 

       
       Security Warning  

       Enabling this option will make the server vulnerable to
      security issues if used with rewrite rules which are not
      carefully authored.  It is  strongly recommended 
      that this option is not used.  In particular, beware of input
      strings containing the ' @ ' character which could
      change the interpretation of the transformed URI, as per the
      above CVE names. 
       
       

        MergeBase  
       

       With this option, the value of   RewriteBase   is copied from where it's explicitly defined
      into any sub-directory or sub-location that doesn't define its own
        RewriteBase  . This was the
      default behavior in 2.4.0 through 2.4.3, and the flag to restore it is
      available Apache HTTP Server 2.4.4 and later.
