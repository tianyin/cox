LogFormat

Description:  Describes a format for use in a log file 
Syntax:   LogFormat  format | nickname 
[ nickname ]  
Default:   LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" % >s %b"  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_log_config 

 This directive specifies the format of the access log
    file. 

     The  LogFormat  directive can take one of two
    forms. In the first form, where only one argument is specified,
    this directive sets the log format which will be used by logs
    specified in subsequent  TransferLog 
    directives. The single argument can specify an explicit
     format  as discussed in the  custom log
    formats  section above. Alternatively, it can use a
     nickname  to refer to a log format defined in a
    previous  LogFormat  directive as described
    below. 

     The second form of the  LogFormat 
    directive associates an explicit  format  with a
     nickname . This  nickname  can then be used in
    subsequent  LogFormat  or
      CustomLog   directives
    rather than repeating the entire format string. A
     LogFormat  directive that defines a nickname
     does nothing else  -- that is, it  only 
    defines the nickname, it doesn't actually apply the format and make
    it the default. Therefore, it will not affect subsequent
      TransferLog   directives.
    In addition,  LogFormat  cannot use one nickname
    to define another nickname. Note that the nickname should not contain
    percent signs ( % ). 

      Example  LogFormat "%v %h %l %u %t \"%r\" % >s %b" vhost_common
