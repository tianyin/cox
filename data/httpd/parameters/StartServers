StartServers

Description:  Number of child server processes created at startup 
Syntax:   StartServers  number   
Default:   See usage for details  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:    event  ,   mpmt_os2  ,   prefork  ,   worker   

 The  StartServers  directive sets the
    number of child server processes created on startup. As the number
    of processes is dynamically controlled depending on the load, (see
      MinSpareThreads  ,
      MaxSpareThreads  ,
      MinSpareServers  ,   MaxSpareServers  )
    there is usually little reason to adjust this parameter. 

     The default value differs from MPM to MPM.   worker  
    defaults to  StartServers 3 ;   prefork  
    defaults to  5 ;   mpmt_os2   defaults to
     2 .
