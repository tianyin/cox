SSLOpenSSLConfCmd

Description:  Configure OpenSSL parameters through its  SSL_CONF  API 
Syntax:   SSLOpenSSLConfCmd  command-name   command-value   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 
Compatibility:  Available in httpd 2.4.8 and later, if using OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later 

 This directive exposes OpenSSL's  SSL_CONF  API to mod_ssl,
allowing a flexible configuration of OpenSSL parameters without the need
of implementing additional   mod_ssl   directives when new
features are added to OpenSSL. 

 The set of available  SSLOpenSSLConfCmd  commands
depends on the OpenSSL version being used for   mod_ssl  
(at least version 1.0.2 is required). For a list of supported command
names, see the section  Supported configuration file commands  in the
 SSL_CONF_cmd(3)  manual page for OpenSSL. 

 Some of the  SSLOpenSSLConfCmd  commands can be used
as an alternative to existing directives (such as
  SSLCipherSuite   or
  SSLProtocol  ),
though it should be noted that the syntax / allowable values for the parameters
may sometimes differ.
