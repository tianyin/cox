CharsetSourceEnc

Description:  Source charset of files 
Syntax:   CharsetSourceEnc  charset   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_charset_lite 

 The  CharsetSourceEnc  directive specifies the
    source charset of files in the associated container. 

     The value of the  charset  argument must be accepted
    as a valid character set name by the character set support in
     APR . Generally, this means that it must be
    supported by iconv. 

      Example  < Directory /export/home/trawick/apacheinst/htdocs/convert >
    CharsetSourceEnc  UTF-16BE
    CharsetDefault    ISO-8859-1
< /Directory > 
 

     The character set names in this example work with the iconv
    translation support in Solaris 8. 

      
     Specifying the same charset for both   CharsetSourceEnc  
     and   CharsetDefault   disables translation. The charset
     need not match the charset of the response, but it must be a valid charset on the system.
