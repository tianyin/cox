TraceEnable

Description:  Determines the behavior on  TRACE  requests 
Syntax:   TraceEnable  [on|off|extended]   
Default:   TraceEnable on  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 This directive overrides the behavior of  TRACE  for both
    the core server and   mod_proxy  .  The default
     TraceEnable on  permits  TRACE  requests per
    RFC 2616, which disallows any request body to accompany the request.
     TraceEnable off  causes the core server and
      mod_proxy   to return a  405  (Method not
    allowed) error to the client. 

     Finally, for testing and diagnostic purposes only, request
    bodies may be allowed using the non-compliant  TraceEnable
    extended  directive.  The core (as an origin server) will
    restrict the request body to 64k (plus 8k for chunk headers if
     Transfer-Encoding: chunked  is used).  The core will
    reflect the full headers and all chunk headers with the response
    body.  As a proxy server, the request body is not restricted to 64k. 

      Note 
     Despite claims to the contrary,  TRACE  is not
    a security vulnerability and there is no viable reason for
    it to be disabled. Doing so necessarily makes your server
    non-compliant.
