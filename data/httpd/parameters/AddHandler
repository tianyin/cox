AddHandler

Description:  Maps the filename extensions to the specified
handler 
Syntax:   AddHandler  handler-name   extension 
[ extension ] ...  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_mime 

 Files having the name  extension  will be served by the
    specified   handler-name  . This
    mapping is added to any already in force, overriding any mappings that
    already exist for the same  extension . For example, to
    activate CGI scripts with the file extension  .cgi , you
    might use: 

     AddHandler cgi-script .cgi 


     Once that has been put into your httpd.conf file, any file containing
    the  .cgi  extension will be treated as a CGI program. 

     The  extension  argument is case-insensitive and can
    be specified with or without a leading dot. Filenames may have  multiple extensions  and the
     extension  argument will be compared against each of
    them.
