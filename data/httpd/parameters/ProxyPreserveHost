ProxyPreserveHost

Description:  Use incoming Host HTTP request header for proxy
request 
Syntax:   ProxyPreserveHost On|Off  
Default:   ProxyPreserveHost Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 
Compatibility:  Usable in directory
context in 2.3.3 and later. 

 When enabled, this option will pass the Host: line from the incoming
    request to the proxied host, instead of the hostname specified in the
     ProxyPass  line. 

     This option should normally be turned  Off . It is mostly
    useful in special configurations like proxied mass name-based virtual
    hosting, where the original Host header needs to be evaluated by the
    backend server.
