MMapFile

Description:  Map a list of files into memory at startup time 
Syntax:   MMapFile  file-path  [ file-path ] ...  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Experimental 
Module:  mod_file_cache 

 The  MMapFile  directive maps one or more files
    (given as whitespace separated arguments) into memory at server
    startup time. They are automatically unmapped on a server
    shutdown. When the files have changed on the filesystem at
    least a  HUP  or  USR1  signal should be send to
    the server to re- mmap()  them. 

     Be careful with the  file-path  arguments: They have
    to literally match the filesystem path Apache's URL-to-filename
    translation handlers create. We cannot compare inodes or other
    stuff to match paths through symbolic links  etc. 
    because that again would cost extra  stat()  system
    calls which is not acceptable. This module may or may not work
    with filenames rewritten by   mod_alias   or
      mod_rewrite  . 

      Example  MMapFile /usr/local/apache/htdocs/index.html
