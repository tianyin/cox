This is used by lower modules to identify the user with a character
string. In particular, this may cause the environment variable
 REMOTE_USER  to be set.  The  varname  can be
any of the  SSL environment variables . 

 Note that this directive has no effect if the
 FakeBasicAuth  option is used (see  SSLOptions ).
