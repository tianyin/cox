Error

Description:  Abort configuration parsing with a custom error message 
Syntax:   Error  message   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 
Compatibility:  2.3.9 and later 

 If an error can be detected within the configuration, this
    directive can be used to generate a custom error message, and halt
    configuration parsing.  The typical use is for reporting required
    modules which are missing from the configuration. 

     # Example
# ensure that mod_include is loaded
< IfModule !include_module >
  Error "mod_include is required by mod_foo.  Load it with LoadModule."
< /IfModule >

# ensure that exactly one of SSL,NOSSL is defined
< IfDefine SSL >
< IfDefine NOSSL >
  Error "Both SSL and NOSSL are defined.  Define only one of them."
< /IfDefine >
< /IfDefine >
< IfDefine !SSL >
< IfDefine !NOSSL >
  Error "Either SSL or NOSSL must be defined."
< /IfDefine >
< /IfDefine >
