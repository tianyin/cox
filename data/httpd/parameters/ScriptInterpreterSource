ScriptInterpreterSource

Description:  Technique for locating the interpreter for CGI
scripts 
Syntax:   ScriptInterpreterSource Registry|Registry-Strict|Script  
Default:   ScriptInterpreterSource Script  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 
Compatibility:  Win32 only. 

 This directive is used to control how Apache httpd finds the
    interpreter used to run CGI scripts. The default setting is
     Script . This causes Apache httpd to use the interpreter pointed to
    by the shebang line (first line, starting with  #! ) in the
    script. On Win32 systems this line usually looks like: 

     #!C:/Perl/bin/perl.exe 


     or, if  perl  is in the  PATH , simply: 

     #!perl 


     Setting  ScriptInterpreterSource Registry  will
    cause the Windows Registry tree  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT  to be
    searched using the script file extension (e.g.,  .pl ) as a
    search key. The command defined by the registry subkey
     Shell\ExecCGI\Command  or, if it does not exist, by the subkey
     Shell\Open\Command  is used to open the script file. If the
    registry keys cannot be found, Apache httpd falls back to the behavior of the
     Script  option. 

      Security 
     Be careful when using  ScriptInterpreterSource
    Registry  with   ScriptAlias  'ed directories, because
    Apache httpd will try to execute  every  file within this
    directory. The  Registry  setting may cause undesired
    program calls on files which are typically not executed. For
    example, the default open command on  .htm  files on
    most Windows systems will execute Microsoft Internet Explorer, so
    any HTTP request for an  .htm  file existing within the
    script directory would start the browser in the background on the
    server. This is a good way to crash your system within a minute or
    so. 
     

     The option  Registry-Strict  which is new in Apache HTTP Server
    2.0 does the same thing as  Registry  but uses only the
    subkey  Shell\ExecCGI\Command . The
     ExecCGI  key is not a common one. It must be
    configured manually in the windows registry and hence prevents
    accidental program calls on your system.
