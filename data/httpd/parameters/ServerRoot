ServerRoot

Description:  Base directory for the server installation 
Syntax:   ServerRoot  directory-path   
Default:   ServerRoot /usr/local/apache  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 The  ServerRoot  directive sets the
    directory in which the server lives. Typically it will contain the
    subdirectories  conf/  and  logs/ . Relative
    paths in other configuration directives (such as   Include   or   LoadModule  , for example) are taken as
    relative to this directory. 

     ServerRoot "/home/httpd" 


     The default location of  ServerRoot  may be
    modified by using the  --prefix  argument to
      configure  , and
    most third-party distributions of the server have a different
    default location from the one listed above.
