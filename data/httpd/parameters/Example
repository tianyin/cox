Example

Description:  Demonstration directive to illustrate the Apache module
API 
Syntax:   Example  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Experimental 
Module:  mod_example 

 The  Example  directive just sets a demonstration
    flag which the example module's content handler displays. It
    takes no arguments. If you browse to an URL to which the
    example content-handler applies, you will get a display of the
    routines within the module and how and in what order they were
    called to service the document request. The effect of this
    directive one can observe under the point " Example
    directive declared here: YES/NO ".
