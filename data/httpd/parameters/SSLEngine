This directive toggles the usage of the SSL/TLS Protocol Engine. This
is should be used inside a   < VirtualHost >   section to enable SSL/TLS for a
that virtual host. By default the SSL/TLS Protocol Engine is
disabled for both the main server and all configured virtual hosts. 
  Example  < VirtualHost _default_:443 >
SSLEngine on
#...
< /VirtualHost > 
 
 In Apache 2.1 and later,  SSLEngine  can be set to
 optional . This enables support for
 RFC 2817 , Upgrading to TLS
Within HTTP/1.1. At this time no web browsers support RFC 2817.
