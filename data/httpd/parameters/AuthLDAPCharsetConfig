AuthLDAPCharsetConfig

Description:  Language to charset conversion configuration file 
Syntax:   AuthLDAPCharsetConfig  file-path   
Context:  server config 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_authnz_ldap 

 The  AuthLDAPCharsetConfig  directive sets the location
    of the language to charset conversion configuration file.  File-path  is relative
    to the   ServerRoot  . This file specifies
    the list of language extensions to character sets.
    Most administrators use the provided  charset.conv 
    file, which associates common language extensions to character sets. 

     The file contains lines in the following format: 

       
       Language-Extension   charset  [ Language-String ] ...
       

     The case of the extension does not matter. Blank lines, and lines
    beginning with a hash character ( # ) are ignored.
