ForensicLog

Description:  Sets filename of the forensic log 
Syntax:   ForensicLog  filename | pipe   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_log_forensic 

 The  ForensicLog  directive is used to
    log requests to the server for forensic analysis. Each log entry
    is assigned a unique ID which can be associated with the request
    using the normal   CustomLog  
    directive.   mod_log_forensic   creates a token called
     forensic-id , which can be added to the transfer log
    using the  %{forensic-id}n  format string. 

     The argument, which specifies the location to which
    the logs will be written, can take one of the following two
    types of values: 

       filename  
       A filename, relative to the   ServerRoot  . 

        pipe  
       The pipe character " | ", followed by the path
      to a program to receive the log information on its standard
      input. The program name can be specified relative to the   ServerRoot   directive.

        Security: 
       If a program is used, then it will be run as the user who
      started   httpd  . This will be root if the server was
      started by root; be sure that the program is secure or switches to a
      less privileged user. 
       

        Note 
         When entering a file path on non-Unix platforms, care should be taken
        to make sure that only forward slashes are used even though the platform
        may allow the use of back slashes. In general it is a good idea to always
        use forward slashes throughout the configuration files.
