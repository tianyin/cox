AuthBasicProvider

Description:  Sets the authentication provider(s) for this location 
Syntax:   AuthBasicProvider  provider-name 
[ provider-name ] ...  
Default:   AuthBasicProvider file  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_auth_basic 

 The  AuthBasicProvider  directive sets
    which provider is used to authenticate the users for this location.
    The default  file  provider is implemented
    by the   mod_authn_file   module.  Make sure
    that the chosen provider module is present in the server. 
      Example  < Location /secure >
    AuthType basic
    AuthName "private area"
    AuthBasicProvider  dbm
    AuthDBMType        SDBM
    AuthDBMUserFile    /www/etc/dbmpasswd
    Require            valid-user
< /Location > 
 
      Providers are queried in order until a provider finds a match
    for the requested username, at which point this sole provider will
    attempt to check the password.  A failure to verify the password does
    not result in control being passed on to subsequent providers. 

     Providers are implemented by   mod_authn_dbm  ,
      mod_authn_file  ,   mod_authn_dbd  ,
      mod_authnz_ldap   and   mod_authn_socache  .
