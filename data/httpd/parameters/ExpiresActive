ExpiresActive

Description:  Enables generation of  Expires 
headers 
Syntax:   ExpiresActive On|Off  
Default:   ExpiresActive Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  Indexes 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_expires 

 This directive enables or disables the generation of the
     Expires  and  Cache-Control  headers for
    the document realm in question.  (That is, if found in an
     .htaccess  file, for instance, it applies only to
    documents generated from that directory.) If set to
     Off , the headers will not be generated for any
    document in the realm (unless overridden at a lower level, such as
    an  .htaccess  file overriding a server config
    file). If set to  On , the headers will be added to
    served documents according to the criteria defined by the
      ExpiresByType   and
      ExpiresDefault  
    directives ( q.v. ). 

     Note that this directive does not guarantee that an
     Expires  or  Cache-Control  header will be
    generated. If the criteria aren't met, no header will be sent, and
    the effect will be as though this directive wasn't even
    specified.
