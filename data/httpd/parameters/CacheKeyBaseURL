CacheKeyBaseURL

Description:  Override the base URL of reverse proxied cache keys. 
Syntax:   CacheKeyBaseURL  URL   
Default:   CacheKeyBaseURL http://example.com  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache 2.3.9 and later 

 When the   CacheKeyBaseURL   directive
  is specified, the URL provided will be used as the base URL to calculate
  the URL of the cache keys in the reverse proxy configuration. When not specified,
  the scheme, hostname and port of the current virtual host is used to construct
  the cache key. When a cluster of machines is present, and all cached entries
  should be cached beneath the same cache key, a new base URL can be specified
  with this directive. 

   # Override the base URL of the cache key.
CacheKeyBaseURL http://www.example.com/ 


   Take care when setting this directive. If two separate virtual
  hosts are accidentally given the same base URL, entries from one virtual host
  will be served to the other.
