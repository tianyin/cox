AuthBasicFake

Description:  Fake basic authentication using the given expressions for
username and password 
Syntax:   AuthBasicFake off|username [password]  
Default:   none  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_auth_basic 
Compatibility:  Apache HTTP Server 2.4.5 and later 

 The username and password specified are combined into an
    Authorization header, which is passed to the server or service
    behind the webserver. Both the username and password fields are
    interpreted using the  expression parser ,
    which allows both the username and password to be set based on
    request parameters. 

     If the password is not specified, the default value "password"
    will be used. To disable fake basic authentication for an URL
    space, specify "AuthBasicFake off". 

     In this example, we pass a fixed username and password to a
    backend server. 

      Fixed Example  < Location /demo >
    AuthBasicFake demo demopass
< /Location > 
 

     In this example, we pass the email address extracted from a client
    certificate, extending the functionality of the FakeBasicAuth option
    within the   SSLOptions  
    directive. Like the FakeBasicAuth option, the password is set to the
    fixed string "password". 

      Certificate Example  < Location /secure >
    AuthBasicFake %{SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_Email}
< /Location > 
 

     Extending the above example, we generate a password by hashing the
    email address with a fixed passphrase, and passing the hash to the
    backend server. This can be used to gate into legacy systems that do
    not support client certificates. 

      Password Example  < Location /secure >
    AuthBasicFake %{SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_Email} %{sha1:passphrase-%{SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_Email}}
< /Location > 
 

      Exclusion Example  < Location /public >
    AuthBasicFake off
< /Location >
