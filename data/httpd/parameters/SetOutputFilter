SetOutputFilter

Description:  Sets the filters that will process responses from the
server 
Syntax:   SetOutputFilter  filter [; filter ...]  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 The  SetOutputFilter  directive sets the filters
    which will process responses from the server before they are
    sent to the client. This is in addition to any filters defined
    elsewhere, including the
      AddOutputFilter  
    directive. 

     For example, the following configuration will process all files
    in the  /www/data/  directory for server-side
    includes. 

     < Directory "/www/data/" >
  SetOutputFilter INCLUDES
< /Directory > 


     If more than one filter is specified, they must be separated
    by semicolons in the order in which they should process the
    content.
