SSLCertificateKeyFile

Description:  Server PEM-encoded private key file 
Syntax:   SSLCertificateKeyFile  file-path   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

 
This directive points to the PEM-encoded private key file for the
server (the private key may also be combined with the certificate in the
  SSLCertificateFile  , but this practice
is discouraged). If the contained private key is encrypted, the pass phrase
dialog is forced at startup time. 

 
The directive can be used multiple times (referencing different filenames)
to support multiple algorithms for server authentication. For each
  SSLCertificateKeyFile  
directive, there must be a matching  SSLCertificateFile 
directive. 

  Example  SSLCertificateKeyFile /usr/local/apache2/conf/ssl.key/server.key
