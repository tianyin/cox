IndexOptions

Description:  Various configuration settings for directory
indexing 
Syntax:   IndexOptions  [+|-] option  [[+|-] option ]
...  
Default:   By default, no options are enabled.  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  Indexes 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_autoindex 

 The  IndexOptions  directive specifies the
    behavior of the directory indexing.  Option  can be one
    of 

       AddAltClass  
       Adds an additional CSS class declaration to each row of the
      directory listing table when  IndexOptions HTMLTable 
      is in effect and an  IndexStyleSheet  is defined.
      Rather than the standard  even  and  odd 
      classes that would otherwise be applied to each row of the table,
      a class of  even- ALT   or
       odd- ALT   where  ALT  is either the
      standard alt text associated with the file style (eg.  snd ,
       txt ,  img , etc) or the alt text defined by one of
      the various  AddAlt*  directives.
       

        Charset= character-set   ( Apache HTTP Server 2.0.61 and
      later ) 

       The  Charset  keyword allows you to
      specify the character set of the generated page. The
      default is  UTF-8  on Windows and Mac OS X,
      and  ISO-8859-1  elsewhere.
      (It depends on whether the underlying file system
      uses Unicode filenames or not.)

       IndexOptions Charset=UTF-8 

       

        DescriptionWidth=[ n  | *]  

       The  DescriptionWidth  keyword allows you to
      specify the width of the description column in
      characters. 

        -DescriptionWidth  (or unset) allows
        mod_autoindex   to calculate the best width. 

        DescriptionWidth= n   fixes the column width to
       n  bytes wide. 

        DescriptionWidth=*  grows the column to the
      width necessary to accommodate the longest description
      string. 

        See the section on   AddDescription   for dangers
      inherent in truncating descriptions.  

        FancyIndexing  

       This turns on fancy indexing of directories. 

        FoldersFirst  

       If this option is enabled, subdirectory listings will
       always  appear first, followed by normal files in the
      directory. The listing is basically broken into two
      components, the files and the subdirectories, and each is
      sorted separately and then displayed subdirectories-first.
      For instance, if the sort order is descending by name, and
       FoldersFirst  is enabled, subdirectory
       Zed  will be listed before subdirectory
       Beta , which will be listed before normal files
       Gamma  and  Alpha .  This option
      only has an effect if   FancyIndexing   is also enabled.  

        HTMLTable  

       This option with  FancyIndexing  constructs
      a simple table for the fancy directory listing.
      It is necessary for utf-8 enabled platforms or if file
      names or description text will alternate between
      left-to-right and right-to-left reading order. 

        IconsAreLinks  

       This makes the icons part of the anchor for the filename, for
      fancy indexing. 

        IconHeight[= pixels ]  

       Presence of this option, when used with  IconWidth ,
      will cause the server to include  height  and
       width  attributes in the  img  tag for the file
      icon. This allows browser to precalculate the page layout without having
      to wait until all the images have been loaded. If no value is given for
      the option, it defaults to the standard height of the icons supplied
      with the Apache httpd software. 

        IconWidth[= pixels ]  

       Presence of this option, when used with  IconHeight ,
      will cause the server to include  height  and
       width  attributes in the  img  tag for
      the file icon. This allows browser to precalculate the page
      layout without having to wait until all the images have been
      loaded. If no value is given for the option, it defaults to
      the standard width of the icons supplied with the Apache httpd
      software. 

        IgnoreCase  

       If this option is enabled, names are sorted in a case-insensitive
      manner.  For instance, if the sort order is ascending by name, and
       IgnoreCase  is enabled, file Zeta  will be listed after
      file alfa (Note: file GAMMA will always be listed before file gamma).
       

        IgnoreClient  

       This option causes   mod_autoindex   to ignore all
      query variables from the client, including sort order (implies
        SuppressColumnSorting  .) 

        NameWidth=[ n 
               | *]  

       The  NameWidth  keyword allows you to specify the width
      of the filename column in bytes. 

        -NameWidth  (or unset) allows   mod_autoindex   to calculate the best width, but only up
      to 20 bytes wide. 

        NameWidth= n   fixes the column width to
       n  bytes wide. 

        NameWidth=*  grows the column to the necessary
      width. 

        ScanHTMLTitles  

       This enables the extraction of the title from HTML documents
      for fancy indexing. If the file does not have a description
      given by   AddDescription  
      then httpd will read the document for the value of the
       title  element. This is CPU and disk intensive. 

        ShowForbidden  

       If specified, Apache httpd will show files normally hidden because
      the subrequest returned  HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED  or
       HTTP_FORBIDDEN  

        SuppressColumnSorting  

       If specified, Apache httpd will not make the column headings in a
      FancyIndexed directory listing into links for sorting. The
      default behavior is for them to be links; selecting the
      column heading will sort the directory listing by the values
      in that column. However, query string arguments which are appended
      to the URL will still be honored. That behavior is controlled by   IndexOptions
      IgnoreClient  . 

        SuppressDescription  

       This will suppress the file description in fancy indexing
      listings. By default, no file descriptions are defined, and
      so the use of this option will regain 23 characters of screen
      space to use for something else. See   AddDescription   for information about setting the file
      description. See also the   DescriptionWidth  
      index option to limit the size of the description column. 

        SuppressHTMLPreamble  

       If the directory actually contains a file specified by the
        HeaderName  
      directive, the module usually includes the contents of the file
      after a standard HTML preamble ( < html > ,
       < head > ,  et cetera ). The
       SuppressHTMLPreamble  option disables this behaviour,
      causing the module to start the display with the header file
      contents. The header file must contain appropriate HTML instructions
      in this case. If there is no header file, the preamble is generated
      as usual. If you also specify a   ReadmeName  , and if that file
      exists, The closing < /body >< /html > tags are also
      ommitted from the output, under the assumption that you'll likely
      put those closing tags in that file. 

        SuppressIcon  

       This will suppress the icon in fancy indexing listings.
      Combining both  SuppressIcon  and
       SuppressRules  yields proper HTML 3.2 output, which
      by the final specification prohibits  img  and
       hr  elements from the  pre  block (used to
      format FancyIndexed listings.) 

        SuppressLastModified  

       This will suppress the display of the last modification date,
      in fancy indexing listings. 

        SuppressRules 
       

       This will suppress the horizontal rule lines ( hr 
      elements) in directory listings. Combining both  SuppressIcon  and
       SuppressRules  yields proper HTML 3.2 output, which
      by the final specification prohibits  img  and
       hr  elements from the  pre  block (used to
      format FancyIndexed listings.) 

        SuppressSize  

       This will suppress the file size in fancy indexing listings. 

        TrackModified  

       This returns the  Last-Modified  and  ETag 
      values for the listed directory in the HTTP header. It is only valid
      if the operating system and file system return appropriate stat()
      results. Some Unix systems do so, as do OS2's JFS and Win32's
      NTFS volumes. OS2 and Win32 FAT volumes, for example, do not.
      Once this feature is enabled, the client or proxy can track
      changes to the list of files when they perform a  HEAD 
      request. Note some operating systems correctly track new and
      removed files, but do not track changes for sizes or dates of
      the files within the directory.  Changes to the size
      or date stamp of an existing file will not update the
       Last-Modified  header on all Unix platforms. 
      If this is a concern, leave this option disabled. 

        Type= MIME content-type   ( Apache HTTP Server 2.0.61 and
      later ) 

       The  Type  keyword allows you to
      specify the MIME content-type of the generated page. The default
      is  text/html .

       IndexOptions Type=text/plain 

       

        VersionSort 
      ( Apache HTTP Server 2.0a3 and later ) 

       The  VersionSort  keyword causes files containing
      version numbers to sort in a natural way. Strings are sorted as
      usual, except that substrings of digits in the name and
      description are compared according to their numeric value.

        Example:   
        foo-1.7 
        foo-1.7.2 
        foo-1.7.12 
        foo-1.8.2 
        foo-1.8.2a 
        foo-1.12
         

       If the number starts with a zero, then it is considered to
      be a fraction: 

         
        foo-1.001 
        foo-1.002 
        foo-1.030 
        foo-1.04
         
       

        XHTML 
      ( Apache HTTP Server 2.0.49 and later ) 

       The  XHTML  keyword forces   mod_autoindex  
      to emit XHTML 1.0 code instead of HTML 3.2. 

       Incremental IndexOptions 
    
      Be aware of how multiple  IndexOptions  are
     handled. 

       Multiple  IndexOptions  directives for a
     single directory are now merged together. The result of:

      < Directory /foo >
    IndexOptions HTMLTable
    IndexOptions SuppressColumnsorting
< /Directory > 


      will be the equivalent of 

      IndexOptions HTMLTable SuppressColumnsorting 

      

      The addition of the incremental syntax ( i.e. , prefixing
     keywords with  +  or  - ). 
       Whenever a '+' or '-' prefixed keyword is encountered, it
     is applied to the current  IndexOptions 
     settings (which may have been inherited from an upper-level
     directory). However, whenever an unprefixed keyword is processed, it
     clears all inherited options and any incremental settings encountered
     so far. Consider the following example: 

      IndexOptions +ScanHTMLTitles -IconsAreLinks FancyIndexing 
IndexOptions +SuppressSize 


      The net effect is equivalent to  IndexOptions FancyIndexing
     +SuppressSize , because the unprefixed  FancyIndexing 
     discarded the incremental keywords before it, but allowed them to
     start accumulating again afterward. 

      To unconditionally set the  IndexOptions  for
     a particular directory, clearing the inherited settings, specify
     keywords without any  +  or  -  prefixes.
