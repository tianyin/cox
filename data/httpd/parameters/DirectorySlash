DirectorySlash

Description:  Toggle trailing slash redirects on or off 
Syntax:   DirectorySlash On|Off  
Default:   DirectorySlash On  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  Indexes 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_dir 

 The  DirectorySlash  directive determines whether
      mod_dir   should fixup URLs pointing to a directory or
    not. 

     Typically if a user requests a resource without a trailing slash, which
    points to a directory,   mod_dir   redirects him to the same
    resource, but  with  trailing slash for some good reasons: 

      The user is finally requesting the canonical URL of the resource 
       mod_autoindex   works correctly. Since it doesn't emit
    the path in the link, it would point to the wrong path. 
       DirectoryIndex   will be evaluated
     only  for directories requested with trailing slash. 
     Relative URL references inside html pages will work correctly. 
      If you don't want this effect  and  the reasons above don't
    apply to you, you can turn off the redirect as shown below. However,
    be aware that there are possible security implications to doing
    this. 

     # see security warning below!
< Location /some/path >
    DirectorySlash Off
    SetHandler some-handler
< /Location > 


      Security Warning 
     Turning off the trailing slash redirect may result in an information
    disclosure. Consider a situation where   mod_autoindex   is
    active ( Options +Indexes ) and   DirectoryIndex   is set to a valid resource (say,
     index.html ) and there's no other special handler defined for
    that URL. In this case a request with a trailing slash would show the
     index.html  file.  But a request without trailing slash
    would list the directory contents . 
     
	 Also note that some browsers may erroneously change POST requests into GET
	(thus discarding POST data) when a redirect is issued.
