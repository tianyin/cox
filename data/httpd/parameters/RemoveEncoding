RemoveEncoding

Description:  Removes any content encoding associations for a set of file
extensions 
Syntax:   RemoveEncoding  extension  [ extension ]
...  
Context:  virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_mime 

 The  RemoveEncoding  directive removes any
    encoding associations for files with the given extensions. This
    allows  .htaccess  files in subdirectories to undo
    any associations inherited from parent directories or the
    server config files. An example of its use might be: 

      /foo/.htaccess:  AddEncoding x-gzip .gz
AddType text/plain .asc
< Files *.gz.asc >
    RemoveEncoding .gz
< /Files > 
 

     This will cause  foo.gz  to be marked as being
    encoded with the gzip method, but  foo.gz.asc  as an
    unencoded plaintext file. 

      Note 
        RemoveEncoding  directives are processed
       after  any   AddEncoding  
      directives, so it is possible they may undo the effects of the latter
      if both occur within the same directory configuration. 
     

     The  extension  argument is case-insensitive and can
    be specified with or without a leading dot.
