NameVirtualHost

Description:  DEPRECATED: Designates an IP address for name-virtual
hosting 
Syntax:   NameVirtualHost  addr [: port ]  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 Prior to 2.3.11,  NameVirtualHost  was required
to instruct the server that a particular IP address and port combination
was usable as a name-based virtual host.  In 2.3.11 and later,
any time an IP address and port combination is used in multiple virtual
hosts, name-based virtual hosting is automatically enabled for that address. 

 This directive currently has no effect.
