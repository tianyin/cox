AuthzDBDQuery

Description:  Specify the SQL Query for the required operation 
Syntax:   AuthzDBDQuery  query   
Context:  directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_authz_dbd 

 The  AuthzDBDQuery  specifies an SQL
    query to run.  The purpose of the query depends on the
      Require   directive in
    effect. 
      When used with a  Require dbd-group  directive,
    it specifies a query to look up groups for the current user.  This is
    the standard functionality of other authorization modules such as
      mod_authz_groupfile   and   mod_authz_dbm  .
    The first column value of each row returned by the query statement
    should be a string containing a group name.  Zero, one, or more rows
    may be returned.
     Require dbd-group
AuthzDBDQuery "SELECT group FROM groups WHERE user = %s" 

     
     When used with a  Require dbd-login  or
     Require dbd-logout  directive, it will never deny access,
    but will instead execute a SQL statement designed to log the user
    in or out.  The user must already be authenticated with
      mod_authn_dbd  .
     Require dbd-login
AuthzDBDQuery "UPDATE authn SET login = 'true' WHERE user = %s" 

     
      In all cases, the user's ID will be passed as a single string
    parameter when the SQL query is executed.  It may be referenced within
    the query statement using a  %s  format specifier.
