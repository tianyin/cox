CheckSpelling

Description:  Enables the spelling
module 
Syntax:   CheckSpelling on|off  
Default:   CheckSpelling Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  Options 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_speling 

 This directive enables or disables the spelling module. When
    enabled, keep in mind that 

      the directory scan which is necessary for the spelling
      correction will have an impact on the server's performance
      when many spelling corrections have to be performed at the
      same time. 

       the document trees should not contain sensitive files
      which could be matched inadvertently by a spelling
      "correction". 

       the module is unable to correct misspelled user names (as
      in  http://my.host/~apahce/ ), just file names or
      directory names. 

       spelling corrections apply strictly to existing files, so
      a request for the  < Location /status >  may
      get incorrectly treated as the negotiated file
      " /stats.html ". 
      mod_speling should not be enabled in  DAV 
    enabled directories, because it will try to "spell fix" newly created
    resource names against existing filenames, e.g., when trying to upload
    a new document  doc43.html  it might redirect to an existing
    document  doc34.html , which is not what was intended.
