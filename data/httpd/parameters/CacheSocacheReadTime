CacheSocacheReadTime

Description:  The minimum time (in milliseconds) that should elapse while reading
  before data is sent downstream 
Syntax:   CacheSocacheReadTime  milliseconds   
Default:   CacheSocacheReadTime 0  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache_socache 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache 2.4.5 and later 

 The  CacheSocacheReadTime  directive sets the minimum amount
    of elapsed time that should pass before making an attempt to send data
    downstream to the client. During the time period, data will be buffered
    before sending the result to the client. This can improve performance when
    caching content from a reverse proxy. 

     The default of zero disables this option. 

     This directive only takes effect when the data is being saved to the
    cache, as opposed to data being served from the cache. It is recommended
    that this option be used alongside the
      CacheSocacheReadSize   directive
    to ensure that the server does not buffer excessively should data arrive faster
    than expected.
