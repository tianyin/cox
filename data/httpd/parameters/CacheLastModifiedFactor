CacheLastModifiedFactor

Description:  The factor used to compute an expiry date based on the
LastModified date. 
Syntax:   CacheLastModifiedFactor  float   
Default:   CacheLastModifiedFactor 0.1  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache 

 In the event that a document does not provide an expiry date but does
    provide a last-modified date, an expiry date can be calculated based on
    the time since the document was last modified. The
     CacheLastModifiedFactor  directive specifies a
     factor  to be used in the generation of this expiry date
    according to the following formula:

     expiry-period = time-since-last-modified-date *  factor 
    expiry-date = current-date + expiry-period 

    For example, if the document was last modified 10 hours ago, and
     factor  is 0.1 then the expiry-period will be set to
    10*0.1 = 1 hour. If the current time was 3:00pm then the computed
    expiry-date would be 3:00pm + 1hour = 4:00pm.

    If the expiry-period would be longer than that set by
     CacheMaxExpire , then the latter takes
    precedence. 

     CacheLastModifiedFactor 0.5
