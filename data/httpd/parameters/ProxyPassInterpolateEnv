ProxyPassInterpolateEnv

Description:  Enable Environment Variable interpolation in Reverse Proxy configurations 
Syntax:   ProxyPassInterpolateEnv On|Off  
Default:   ProxyPassInterpolateEnv Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 
Compatibility:  Available in httpd 2.2.9 and later 

 This directive, together with the  interpolate  argument to
     ProxyPass ,  ProxyPassReverse ,
     ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain  and
     ProxyPassReverseCookiePath 
    enables reverse proxies to be dynamically
    configured using environment variables, which may be set by
    another module such as   mod_rewrite  .
    It affects the  ProxyPass ,
     ProxyPassReverse ,
     ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain , and
     ProxyPassReverseCookiePath  directives,
    and causes them to substitute the value of an environment
    variable  varname  for the string  ${varname} 
    in configuration directives (if the  interpolate  option is set). 
     Keep this turned off (for server performance) unless you need it!
