ProxyRemote

Description:  Remote proxy used to handle certain requests 
Syntax:   ProxyRemote  match   remote-server   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 

 This defines remote proxies to this proxy.  match  is either the
    name of a URL-scheme that the remote server supports, or a partial URL
    for which the remote server should be used, or  *  to indicate
    the server should be contacted for all requests.  remote-server  is
    a partial URL for the remote server. Syntax: 

       
       remote-server  =
           scheme :// hostname [: port ]
       

      scheme  is effectively the protocol that should be used to
    communicate with the remote server; only  http  and  https 
    are supported by this module. When using  https , the requests
    are forwarded through the remote proxy using the HTTP CONNECT method. 

      Example  ProxyRemote http://goodguys.example.com/ http://mirrorguys.example.com:8000
ProxyRemote * http://cleverproxy.localdomain
ProxyRemote ftp http://ftpproxy.mydomain:8080 
 

     In the last example, the proxy will forward FTP requests, encapsulated
    as yet another HTTP proxy request, to another proxy which can handle
    them. 

     This option also supports reverse proxy configuration - a backend
    webserver can be embedded within a virtualhost URL space even if that
    server is hidden by another forward proxy.
