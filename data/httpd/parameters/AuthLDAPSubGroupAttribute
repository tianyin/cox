 An LDAP group object may contain members that are users and
    members that are groups (called nested or sub groups). The
     AuthLDAPSubGroupAttribute  directive identifies the
    labels of group members and the  AuthLDAPGroupAttribute 
    directive identifies the labels of the user members. Multiple
    attributes can be used by specifying this directive multiple times.
    If not specified, then   mod_authnz_ldap   uses the
     member  and  uniqueMember  attributes.
