CacheFile

Description:  Cache a list of file handles at startup time 
Syntax:   CacheFile  file-path  [ file-path ] ...  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Experimental 
Module:  mod_file_cache 

 The  CacheFile  directive opens handles to
    one or more files (given as whitespace separated arguments) and
    places these handles into the cache at server startup
    time. Handles to cached files are automatically closed on a server
    shutdown.  When the files have changed on the filesystem, the
    server should be restarted to re-cache them. 

     Be careful with the  file-path  arguments: They have
    to literally match the filesystem path Apache's URL-to-filename
    translation handlers create. We cannot compare inodes or other
    stuff to match paths through symbolic links  etc. 
    because that again would cost extra  stat()  system
    calls which is not acceptable. This module may or may not work
    with filenames rewritten by   mod_alias   or
      mod_rewrite  . 

      Example  CacheFile /usr/local/apache/htdocs/index.html
