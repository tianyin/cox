AuthDBMUserFile

Description:  Sets the name of a database file containing the list of users and
passwords for authentication 
Syntax:   AuthDBMUserFile  file-path   
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_authn_dbm 

 The  AuthDBMUserFile  directive sets the
    name of a DBM file containing the list of users and passwords for
    user authentication.  File-path  is the absolute path to
    the user file. 

     The user file is keyed on the username. The value for a user is
    the encrypted password, optionally followed by a colon and arbitrary
    data. The colon and the data following it will be ignored by the
    server. 

      Security: 
       Make sure that the  AuthDBMUserFile  is stored
      outside the document tree of the web-server; do  not  put it in
      the directory that it protects. Otherwise, clients will be able to
      download the  AuthDBMUserFile . 
     

     The encrypted password format depends on which authentication
    frontend (e.g.   mod_auth_basic   or
      mod_auth_digest  ) is being used.  See  Password Formats  for
    more information. 

     Important compatibility note: The implementation of
     dbmopen  in the apache modules reads the string length of
    the hashed values from the DBM data structures, rather than relying
    upon the string being NULL-appended. Some applications, such as
    the Netscape web server, rely upon the string being
    NULL-appended, so if you are having trouble using DBM files
    interchangeably between applications this may be a part of the
    problem. 

     A perl script called
      dbmmanage   is included with
    Apache. This program can be used to create and update DBM
    format password files for use with this module. Another
    tool for maintaining the DBM files is the included program
      htdbm  .
