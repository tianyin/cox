Alias

Description:  Maps URLs to filesystem locations 
Syntax:   Alias  URL-path 
 file-path | directory-path   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_alias 

 The  Alias  directive allows documents to
    be stored in the local filesystem other than under the
      DocumentRoot  . URLs with a
    (%-decoded) path beginning with  URL-path  will be mapped
    to local files beginning with  directory-path .  The
     URL-path  is case-sensitive, even on case-insensitive
    file systems. 

     Alias /image /ftp/pub/image 


     A request for  http://example.com/image/foo.gif  would cause
    the server to return the file  /ftp/pub/image/foo.gif .  Only
    complete path segments are matched, so the above alias would not match a
    request for  http://example.com/imagefoo.gif .  For more complex
    matching using regular expressions, see the   AliasMatch   directive. 

     Note that if you include a trailing / on the
     URL-path  then the server will require a trailing / in
    order to expand the alias. That is, if you use 

     Alias /icons/ /usr/local/apache/icons/ 


     then the url  /icons  will not be aliased, as it lacks
    that trailing /. Likewise, if you omit the slash on the
     URL-path  then you must also omit it from the
     file-path . 

     Note that you may need to specify additional   < Directory >   sections which
    cover the  destination  of aliases.  Aliasing occurs before
      < Directory >   sections
    are checked, so only the destination of aliases are affected.
    (Note however   < Location >  
    sections are run through once before aliases are performed, so
    they will apply.) 

     In particular, if you are creating an  Alias  to a
    directory outside of your   DocumentRoot  , you may need to explicitly
    permit access to the target directory. 

     Alias /image /ftp/pub/image
< Directory /ftp/pub/image >
    Require all granted
< /Directory > 


     Any number slashes in the  URL-path  parameter 
    matches any number of slashes in the requested URL-path.
