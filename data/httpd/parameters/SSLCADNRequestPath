SSLCADNRequestPath

Description:  Directory of PEM-encoded CA Certificates for
defining acceptable CA names 
Syntax:   SSLCADNRequestPath  directory-path   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

 This optional directive can be used to specify the set of
 acceptable CA names  which will be sent to the client when a
client certificate is requested.  See the   SSLCADNRequestFile   directive for more
details. 

 The files in this directory have to be PEM-encoded and are accessed
through hash filenames. So usually you can't just place the
Certificate files there: you also have to create symbolic links named
 hash-value  .N . And you should always make sure
this directory contains the appropriate symbolic links. 
  Example  SSLCADNRequestPath /usr/local/apache2/conf/ca-names.crt/
