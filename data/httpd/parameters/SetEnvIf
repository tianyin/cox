SetEnvIf

Description:  Sets environment variables based on attributes of the request
 
Syntax:   SetEnvIf  attribute
    regex [!]env-variable [= value ]
    [[!] env-variable [= value ]] ...  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_setenvif 

 The  SetEnvIf  directive defines
    environment variables based on attributes of the request. The
     attribute  specified in the first argument can be one of four
    things: 

  An HTTP request header field (see  RFC2616 
    for more information about these); for example:  Host ,
     User-Agent ,  Referer , and
     Accept-Language .  A regular expression may be
    used to specify a set of request headers. 

 One of the following aspects of the request:
       Remote_Host  - the hostname (if available) of
      the client making the request 

        Remote_Addr  - the IP address of the client
      making the request 

        Server_Addr  - the IP address of the server
      on which the request was received (only with versions later
      than 2.0.43) 

        Request_Method  - the name of the method
      being used ( GET ,  POST ,  et
      cetera ) 

        Request_Protocol  - the name and version of
      the protocol with which the request was made ( e.g. ,
      "HTTP/0.9", "HTTP/1.1",  etc. ) 

        Request_URI  - the resource requested on the HTTP
       request line -- generally the portion of the URL
      following the scheme and host portion without the query string. See
      the   RewriteCond  
      directive of   mod_rewrite   for extra information on
      how to match your query string. 
      

 The name of an environment variable in the list of those
associated with the request. This allows
 SetEnvIf  directives to test against the result
of prior matches. Only those environment variables defined by earlier
 SetEnvIf[NoCase]  directives are available for testing in
this manner. 'Earlier' means that they were defined at a broader scope
(such as server-wide) or previously in the current directive's scope.
Environment variables will be considered only if there was no match
among request characteristics and a regular expression was not
used for the  attribute . 

  The second argument ( regex ) is a  regular expression .  If the  regex 
matches against the  attribute , then the remainder of the
arguments are evaluated. 

 The rest of the arguments give the names of variables to set, and
optionally values to which they should be set. These take the form
of 

        varname  , or 

        ! varname  , or 

         varname = value   
      In the first form, the value will be set to "1". The second
    will remove the given variable if already defined, and the
    third will set the variable to the literal value given by
      value  . Since version 2.0.51, Apache httpd will
    recognize occurrences of  $1 .. $9  within
     value  and replace them by parenthesized subexpressions
    of  regex . 

 SetEnvIf Request_URI "\.gif$" object_is_image=gif
SetEnvIf Request_URI "\.jpg$" object_is_image=jpg
SetEnvIf Request_URI "\.xbm$" object_is_image=xbm
    
SetEnvIf Referer www\.mydomain\.example\.com intra_site_referral
    
SetEnvIf object_is_image xbm XBIT_PROCESSING=1
    
SetEnvIf ^TS  ^[a-z]  HAVE_TS 


     The first three will set the environment variable
     object_is_image  if the request was for an image
    file, and the fourth sets  intra_site_referral  if
    the referring page was somewhere on the
     www.mydomain.example.com  Web site. 

     The last example will set environment variable
     HAVE_TS  if the request contains any headers that
    begin with "TS" whose values begins with any character in the
    set [a-z].
