ExtendedStatus

Description:  Keep track of extended status information for each
request 
Syntax:   ExtendedStatus On|Off  
Default:   ExtendedStatus Off[*]  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 This option tracks additional data per worker about the
    currently executing request, and a utilization summary; you
    can see these variables during runtime by configuring
      mod_status  .  Note that other modules may
    rely on this scoreboard. 

     This setting applies to the entire server, and cannot be
    enabled or disabled on a virtualhost-by-virtualhost basis.
    The collection of extended status information can slow down
    the server.  Also note that this setting cannot be changed
    during a graceful restart. 

     
     Note that loading   mod_status   will change
    the default behavior to ExtendedStatus On, while other
    third party modules may do the same.  Such modules rely on
    collecting detailed information about the state of all workers.
    The default is changed by   mod_status   beginning
    with version 2.3.6; the previous default was always Off.
