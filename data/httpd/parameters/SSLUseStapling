SSLUseStapling

Description:  Enable stapling of OCSP responses in the TLS handshake 
Syntax:   SSLUseStapling on|off  
Default:   SSLUseStapling off  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 
Compatibility:  Available if using OpenSSL 0.9.8h or later 

 This option enables OCSP stapling, as defined by the "Certificate
Status Request" TLS extension specified in RFC 6066. If enabled (and
requested by the client), mod_ssl will include an OCSP response
for its own certificate in the TLS handshake. Configuring an
  SSLStaplingCache   is a
prerequisite for enabling OCSP stapling. 

 OCSP stapling relieves the client of querying the OCSP responder
on its own, but it should be noted that with the RFC 6066 specification,
the server's  CertificateStatus  reply may only include an
OCSP response for a single cert. For server certificates with intermediate
CA certificates in their chain (the typical case nowadays),
stapling in its current implementation therefore only partially achieves the
stated goal of "saving roundtrips and resources" - see also
 RFC 6961 
(TLS Multiple Certificate Status Extension).
