RemoveHandler

Description:  Removes any handler associations for a set of file
extensions 
Syntax:   RemoveHandler  extension  [ extension ]
...  
Context:  virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_mime 

 The  RemoveHandler  directive removes any
    handler associations for files with the given extensions. This allows
     .htaccess  files in subdirectories to undo any
    associations inherited from parent directories or the server
    config files. An example of its use might be: 

      /foo/.htaccess:  AddHandler server-parsed .html 
 

      /foo/bar/.htaccess:  RemoveHandler .html 
 

     This has the effect of returning  .html  files in
    the  /foo/bar  directory to being treated as normal
    files, rather than as candidates for parsing (see the   mod_include   module). 

     The  extension  argument is case-insensitive and can
    be specified with or without a leading dot.
