DBDPersist

Description:  Whether to use persistent connections 
Syntax:   DBDPersist On|Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_dbd 

 If set to Off, persistent and pooled connections are disabled.
    A new database connection is opened when requested by a client,
    and closed immediately on release.  This option is for debugging
    and low-usage servers. 

     The default is to enable a pool of persistent connections
    (or a single LAMP-style persistent connection in the case of a
    non-threaded server), and should almost always be used in operation. 

     Prior to version 2.2.2, this directive accepted only the values
     0  and  1  instead of  Off  and
     On , respectively.
