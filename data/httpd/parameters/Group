Group

Description:  Group under which the server will answer
requests 
Syntax:   Group  unix-group   
Default:   Group #-1  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_unixd 

 The  Group  directive sets the group under
    which the server will answer requests. In order to use this
    directive, the server must be run initially as  root . If
    you start the server as a non-root user, it will fail to change to the
    specified group, and will instead continue to run as the group of the
    original user.  Unix-group  is one of: 

      A group name 
       Refers to the given group by name. 

        #  followed by a group number. 
       Refers to a group by its number. 
       Example  Group www-group 
 

     It is recommended that you set up a new group specifically for
    running the server. Some admins use user  nobody ,
    but this is not always possible or desirable. 

      Security 
       Don't set  Group  (or   User  ) to  root  unless
      you know exactly what you are doing, and what the dangers are.
