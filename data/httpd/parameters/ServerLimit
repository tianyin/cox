ServerLimit

Description:  Upper limit on configurable number of processes 
Syntax:   ServerLimit  number   
Default:   See usage for details  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:    event  ,   prefork  ,   worker   

 For the   prefork   MPM, this directive sets the
    maximum configured value for   MaxRequestWorkers   for the lifetime of the
    Apache httpd process.  For the   worker   MPM, this directive
    in combination with   ThreadLimit   sets
    the maximum configured value for   MaxRequestWorkers   for the lifetime of the
    Apache httpd process.  Any attempts to change this directive during a
    restart will be ignored, but   MaxRequestWorkers   can be modified during
    a restart. 

     Special care must be taken when using this directive.  If
     ServerLimit  is set to a value much higher
    than necessary, extra, unused shared memory will be allocated.  If
    both  ServerLimit  and   MaxRequestWorkers   are set to values
    higher than the system can handle, Apache httpd may not start or the
    system may become unstable. 

     With the   prefork   MPM, use this directive only
    if you need to set   MaxRequestWorkers   higher than 256 (default).
    Do not set the value of this directive any higher than what you
    might want to set   MaxRequestWorkers   to. 

     With   worker  , use this directive only
    if your   MaxRequestWorkers   and
      ThreadsPerChild  
    settings require more than 16 server processes (default). Do not set
    the value of this directive any higher than the number of server
    processes required by what you may want for   MaxRequestWorkers    and   ThreadsPerChild  . 

      Note 
       There is a hard limit of  ServerLimit 20000  compiled
      into the server (for the   prefork   MPM 200000). This is
      intended to avoid nasty effects caused by typos. To increase it
      even further past this limit, you will need to modify the value of
      MAX_SERVER_LIMIT in the mpm source file and rebuild the server.
