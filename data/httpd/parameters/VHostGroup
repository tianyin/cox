Syntax:   VHostGroup  unix-groupid

  Group    
Context:  virtual host 
Status:  Experimental

 The  VHostGroup  directive sets the Unix group
    under which the server will process requests to a virtualhost.
    The group is set before the request is processed and reset afterwards
    using  Solaris Privileges .  Since the setting applies to the
     process , this is not compatible with threaded MPMs. 
      Unix-group  is one of: 
      A group name 
       Refers to the given group by name. 

        #  followed by a group number. 
       Refers to a group by its number. 
       Security 
     This directive cannot be used to run apache as root!
    Nevertheless, it opens potential security issues similar to
    those discussed in the  suexec 
    documentation.
