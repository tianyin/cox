RedirectMatch

Description:  Sends an external redirect based on a regular expression match
of the current URL 
Syntax:   RedirectMatch [ status ]  regex 
 URL   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_alias 

 This directive is equivalent to   Redirect  , but makes use of
     regular expressions ,
    instead of simple prefix matching. The
    supplied regular expression is matched against the URL-path, and
    if it matches, the server will substitute any parenthesized
    matches into the given string and use it as a filename. For
    example, to redirect all GIF files to like-named JPEG files on
    another server, one might use: 

     RedirectMatch (.*)\.gif$ http://other.example.com$1.jpg 


     The considerations related to the difference between
      Alias   and
      AliasMatch  
    also apply to the difference between
      Redirect   and
      RedirectMatch  .
    See   AliasMatch   for
    details.
