ThreadsPerChild

Description:  Number of threads created by each child process 
Syntax:   ThreadsPerChild  number   
Default:   See usage for details  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:    event  ,   mpm_winnt  ,   worker   

 This directive sets the number of threads created by each
    child process. The child creates these threads at startup and
    never creates more. If using an MPM like   mpm_winnt  ,
    where there is only one child process, this number should be high
    enough to handle the entire load of the server. If using an MPM
    like   worker  , where there are multiple child processes,
    the  total  number of threads should be high enough to handle
    the common load on the server. 

     The default value for  ThreadsPerChild  is
     64  when used with   mpm_winnt   and
     25  when used with the others.
