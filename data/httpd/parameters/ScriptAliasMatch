ScriptAliasMatch

Description:  Maps a URL to a filesystem location using a regular expression
and designates the target as a CGI script 
Syntax:   ScriptAliasMatch  regex 
 file-path | directory-path   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_alias 

 This directive is equivalent to   ScriptAlias  , but makes use of
     regular expressions ,
    instead of simple prefix matching. The
    supplied regular expression is matched against the URL-path,
    and if it matches, the server will substitute any parenthesized
    matches into the given string and use it as a filename. For
    example, to activate the standard  /cgi-bin , one
    might use: 

     ScriptAliasMatch ^/cgi-bin(.*) /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin$1 


     As for AliasMatch, the full range of  regular
    expression  power is available.
    For example, it is possible to construct an alias with case-insensitive
    matching of the URL-path: 

     ScriptAliasMatch (?i)^/cgi-bin(.*) /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin$1 


     The considerations related to the difference between
      Alias   and
      AliasMatch  
    also apply to the difference between
      ScriptAlias   and
      ScriptAliasMatch  .
    See   AliasMatch   for
    details.
