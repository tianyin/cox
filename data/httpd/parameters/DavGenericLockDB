DavGenericLockDB

Description:  Location of the DAV lock database 
Syntax:   DavGenericLockDB  file-path   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_dav_lock 

 Use the  DavGenericLockDB  directive to specify
    the full path to the lock database, excluding an extension. If
    the path is not absolute, it will be interpreted relative to   ServerRoot  . The implementation of
      mod_dav_lock   uses a SDBM database to track user
    locks. 

      Example  DavGenericLockDB var/DavLock 
 

     The directory containing the lock database file must be
    writable by the   User  
    and   Group   under which
    Apache is running.  For security reasons, you should create a
    directory for this purpose rather than changing the permissions on
    an existing directory.  In the above example, Apache will create
    files in the  var/  directory under the   ServerRoot   with the base filename
     DavLock  and an extension added by the server.
