Just like dfs.datanode.readahead.bytes, this setting causes the datanode to
    read ahead in the block file using posix_fadvise, potentially decreasing
    I/O wait times.  Unlike dfs.datanode.readahead.bytes, this is a client-side
    setting rather than a setting for the entire datanode.  If present, this
    setting will override the DataNode default.

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
    configuration has no effect.
