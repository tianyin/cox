Indicate whether or not to avoid writing to "stale" datanodes whose 
    heartbeat messages have not been received by the namenode 
    for more than a specified time interval. Writes will avoid using 
    stale datanodes unless more than a configured ratio 
    (dfs.namenode.write.stale.datanode.ratio) of datanodes are marked as 
    stale. See dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode for a similar setting
    for reads.
