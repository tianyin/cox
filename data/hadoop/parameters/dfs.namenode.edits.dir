${dfs.namenode.name.dir}
Determines where on the local filesystem the DFS name node
      should store the transaction (edits) file. If this is a comma-delimited list
      of directories then the transaction file is replicated in all of the 
      directories, for redundancy. Default value is same as dfs.namenode.name.dir
