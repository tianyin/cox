If the space in mapreduce.cluster.local.dir drops under this, 
    do not ask more tasks until all the current ones have finished and 
    cleaned up. Also, to save the rest of the tasks we have running, 
    kill one of them, to clean up some space. Start with the reduce tasks,
    then go with the ones that have finished the least.
