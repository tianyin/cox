The number of log files           in the log group.           InnoDB writes to the files in a circular           fashion. The default (and recommended) value is 2. The           location of these files is specified by           innodb_log_group_home_dir.           The combined size of log files           (innodb_log_file_size *           innodb_log_files_in_group) can be up to           512GB.
