If set to 1, MySQL aborts           UPDATE or           DELETE statements that do not           use a key in the WHERE clause or a           LIMIT clause. (Specifically,           UPDATE statements must have a           WHERE clause that uses a key or a           LIMIT clause, or both.           DELETE statements must have           both.) This makes it possible to catch           UPDATE or           DELETE statements where keys           are not used properly and that would probably change or delete           a large number of rows. The default value is 0.
