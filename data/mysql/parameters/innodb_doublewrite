If this variable is enabled (the default),           InnoDB stores all data twice, first to the           doublewrite           buffer, then to the actual           data files. This           variable can be turned off with           skipinnodb_doublewrite for benchmarks or           cases when top performance is needed rather than concern for           data integrity or possible failures.
