The number of background threads devoted to the InnoDB           purge operation. The new           default and minimum value of 1 in MySQL 5.6.5 signifies that           the purge operation is always performed by background threads,           never as part of the master           thread. Nonzero values runs the purge operation in one           or more background threads, which can reduce internal           contention within InnoDB, improving scalability. Increasing           the value to greater than 1 creates that many separate purge           threads, which can improve efficiency on systems where           DML operations are performed           on multiple tables. The maximum is 32.
