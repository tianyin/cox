A parameter that influences the algorithms and heuristics for           the flush operation for the           InnoDB           buffer pool. Primarily           of interest to performance experts tuning I/Ointensive           workloads. It specifies, per buffer pool instance, how far           down the buffer pool LRU list the           page_cleaner thread scans looking for           dirty pages to flush.           This is a background operation performed once a second. If you           have spare I/O capacity under a typical workload, increase the           value. If a writeintensive workload saturates your I/O           capacity, decrease the value, especially if you have a large           buffer pool. For general I/O tuning advice, see           SectionÂ 8.5.7, âOptimizing InnoDB Disk I/Oâ.
