The size in bytes of each log           file in a log           group. The combined size of log files           (innodb_log_file_size *           innodb_log_files_in_group)           cannot exceed a maximum value that is slightly less than           512GB. A pair of 255 GB log files, for example, would allow           you to approach the limit but not exceed it. The default value           is 48MB. Sensible values range from 1MB to           1/Nth of the size of the           buffer pool, where           N is the number of log files in the           group. The larger the value, the less checkpoint flush           activity is needed in the buffer pool, saving disk I/O. Larger           log files also make crash           recovery slower, although improvements to recovery           performance in MySQL 5.5 and higher make the log file size           less of a consideration. For general I/O tuning advice, see           SectionÂ 8.5.7, âOptimizing InnoDB Disk I/Oâ.
