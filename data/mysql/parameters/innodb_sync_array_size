Splits an internal data structure used to coordinate threads,           for higher concurrency in workloads with large numbers of           waiting threads. This setting must be configured when the           MySQL instance is starting up, and cannot be changed           afterward. Increasing this option value is recommended for           workloads that frequently produce a large number of waiting           threads, typically greater than 768.
