Added in MySQL 5.6.2, this option enables           binlog_rows_query_log_events.           Must be set to OFF (the default) when           generating logs for a MySQL 5.6.1 or earlier slave server or           version of mysqlbinlog.  These events are normally ignored by MySQL 5.6.2 and later           programs reading the binary log and so cause no issues when           replicating or restoring from backup. This is not true for a           mysqld or mysqlbinlog           from MySQL 5.6.1 or earlier: When the older version of the           program reading the log encounters an informational log event,           it fails, and stops reading at that point. To make the binary           log readable by slave replication MySQL servers and other           readers (for example, mysqlbinlog) from a           MySQL 5.6.1 or earlier distribution,           binlog_rows_query_log_events           must be disabled during logging.
