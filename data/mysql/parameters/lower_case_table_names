In previous versions of MySQL, using different settings for           lower_case_table_names on replication           masters and slaves could cause replication to fail when the           slave used a casesensitive file system. This issue is           resolved in MySQL 5.6.1. For more information, see           SectionÂ 16.4.1.33, âReplication and Variablesâ.
