Many operating systems and some disk hardware fool the             flushtodisk operation. They may tell             mysqld that the flush has taken place,             even though it has not. Then the durability of transactions             is not guaranteed even with the setting 1, and in the worst             case a power outage can even corrupt             InnoDB data. Using a batterybacked disk             cache in the SCSI disk controller or in the disk itself             speeds up file flushes, and makes the operation safer. You             can also try using the Unix command             hdparm to disable the caching of disk             writes in hardware caches, or use some other command             specific to the hardware vendor.  Always set               innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1.
