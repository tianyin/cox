The path to a file with a list of trusted SSL CAs.  If you use SSL when establishing a client connection, to             tell the client not to authenticate the server certificate,             specify neither sslca nor             sslcapath. The server             still verifies the client according to any applicable             requirements established using             GRANT statements for the             client account, and it still uses any             sslca or             sslcapath option values             specified at server startup.
