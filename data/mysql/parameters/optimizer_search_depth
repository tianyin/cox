The maximum depth of search performed by the query optimizer.           Values larger than the number of relations in a query result           in better query plans, but take longer to generate an           execution plan for a query. Values smaller than the number of           relations in a query return an execution plan quicker, but the           resulting plan may be far from being optimal. If set to 0, the           system automatically picks a reasonable value.
