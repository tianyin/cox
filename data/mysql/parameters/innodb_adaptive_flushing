Specifies whether to dynamically adjust the rate of flushing           dirty pages in the           InnoDB           buffer pool based on           the workload. Adjusting the flush rate dynamically is intended           to avoid bursts of I/O activity. This setting is enabled by           default. See           SectionÂ 14.2.12.2.21, âControlling the Flushing Rate of Dirty Pages from the InnoDB Buffer Poolâ for           more information. For general I/O tuning advice, see           SectionÂ 8.5.7, âOptimizing InnoDB Disk I/Oâ.
