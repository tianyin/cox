The SQL thread sends an acknowledgment to the client before             it executes init_slave.             Therefore, it is not guaranteed that             init_slave has been             executed when START SLAVE             returns. See SectionÂ 13.4.2.5, âSTART SLAVE Syntaxâ, for more             information.
