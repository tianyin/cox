Write and flush the logs every N           seconds.           innodb_flush_log_at_timeout           was introduced in MySQL 5.6.6. It allows the timeout period           between flushes to be increased in order to reduce flushing           and avoid impacting performance of binary log group commit.           Prior to MySQL 5.6.6, flushing frequency was once per second.           The default setting for           innodb_flush_log_at_timeout           is also once per second.  As of MySQL 5.6.6, InnoDB log               flushing frequency is controlled by               innodb_flush_log_at_timeout,               which allows you to set log flushing frequency to               N seconds (where               N is 1 ...               2700, with a default value of 1). However, any               mysqld process crash can erase up to               N seconds of transactions.
