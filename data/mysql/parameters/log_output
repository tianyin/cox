The destination for general query log and slow query log           output. The value can be a commaseparated list of one or more           of the words TABLE (log to tables),           FILE (log to files), or           NONE (do not log to tables or files). The           default value is FILE.           NONE, if present, takes precedence over any           other specifiers. If the value is NONE log           entries are not written even if the logs are enabled. If the           logs are not enabled, no logging occurs even if the value of           log_output is not           NONE. For more information, see           SectionÂ 5.2.1, âSelecting General Query and Slow Query Log Output Destinationsâ.
