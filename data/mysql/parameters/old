Currently, when old is           enabled, it changes the default scope of index hints to that           used prior to MySQL 5.1.17. That is, index hints with no           FOR clause apply only to how indexes are           used for row retrieval and not to resolution of ORDER           BY or GROUP BY clauses. (See           SectionÂ 13.2.9.3, âIndex Hint Syntaxâ.) Take care about enabling this           in a replication setup. With statementbased binary logging,           having different modes for the master and slaves might lead to           replication errors.
