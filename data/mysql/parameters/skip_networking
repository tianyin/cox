This is ON if the server permits only local           (nonTCP/IP) connections. On Unix, local connections use a           Unix socket file. On Windows, local connections use a named           pipe or shared memory. This variable can be set to           ON with the           skipnetworking option.  Do not listen for TCP/IP connections at all. All interaction           with mysqld must be made using named pipes           or shared memory (on Windows) or Unix socket files (on Unix).           This option is highly recommended for systems where only local           clients are permitted. See SectionÂ 8.11.5.2, âDNS Lookup Optimization and the Host Cacheâ.
