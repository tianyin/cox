When this option is enabled, information about all           deadlocks in           InnoDB user transactions is recorded in the           mysqld error           log. Otherwise, you see information about only the last           deadlock, using the SHOW ENGINE INNODB           STATUS command. An occasional           InnoDB deadlock is not necessarily an           issue, because InnoDB detects the condition           immediately, and rolls back one of the transactions           automatically. You might use this option to troubleshoot why           deadlocks are happening if an application does not have           appropriate errorhandling logic to detect the rollback and           retry its operation. A large number of deadlocks might           indicate the need to restructure transactions that issue           DML or SELECT ... FOR           UPDATE statements for multiple tables, so that each           transaction accesses the tables in the same order, thus           avoiding the deadlock condition.
