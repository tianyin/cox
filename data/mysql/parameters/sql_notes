If set to 1 (the default), warnings of Note           level increment warning_count and the           server records them. If set to 0, Note           warnings do not increment           warning_count and the server           does not record them. mysqldump includes           output to set this variable to 0 so that reloading the dump           file does not produce warnings for events that do not affect           the integrity of the reload operation.
