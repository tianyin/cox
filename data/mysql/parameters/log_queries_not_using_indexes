Whether queries that do not use indexes are logged to the slow           query log. See SectionÂ 5.2.5, âThe Slow Query Logâ.  If you are using this option with the slow query log enabled,           queries that are expected to retrieve all rows are logged. See           SectionÂ 5.2.5, âThe Slow Query Logâ. This option does not           necessarily mean that no index is used. For example, a query           that uses a full index scan uses an index but would be logged           because the index would not limit the number of rows.
