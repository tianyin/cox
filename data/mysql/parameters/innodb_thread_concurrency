The range of this variable is 0 to 1000. A value of 0 (the           default) is interpreted as infinite concurrency (no           concurrency checking). Disabling thread concurrency checking           enables InnoDB to create as many threads as it needs. A value           of 0 also disables the queries inside           InnoDB and queries in queue           counters in the ROW OPERATIONS           section of SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS           output.
