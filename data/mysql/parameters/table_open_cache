The number of open tables for all threads. Increasing this           value increases the number of file descriptors that           mysqld requires. You can check whether you           need to increase the table cache by checking the           Opened_tables status           variable. See SectionÂ 5.1.6, âServer Status Variablesâ. If           the value of Opened_tables           is large and you do not use           FLUSH TABLES           often (which just forces all tables to be closed and           reopened), then you should increase the value of the           table_open_cache variable.           For more information about the table cache, see           SectionÂ 8.4.3.1, âHow MySQL Opens and Closes Tablesâ.
