This variable specifies the locale that controls the language           used to display day and month names and abbreviations. This           variable affects the output from the           DATE_FORMAT(),           DAYNAME() and           MONTHNAME() functions. Locale           names are POSIXstyle values such as           'ja_JP' or 'pt_BR'. The           default value is 'en_US' regardless of your           system's locale setting.
