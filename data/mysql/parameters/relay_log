Beginning with MySQL 5.6.2, you can obtain the relay log           filename (and path) from the           relay_log_basename system           variable.  If you specify this option, the value specified is also used           as the basename for the relay logs. You can override this           behavior by specifying a different relay log file basename           using the relaylog option.  The directory specified by this option should be located in a           diskbased file system (not a memorybased file system)           because the temporary files used to replicate           LOAD DATA           INFILE must survive machine restarts. The directory           also should not be one that is cleared by the operating system           during the system startup process.  The name of the relay log file.
