In MySQL 5.1, this option caused the server to behave as if           the builtin InnoDB were not present, which           enabled InnoDB Plugin to be used instead.           In MySQL 5.6, InnoDB is the           default storage engine and InnoDB Plugin is           not used, so this option has no effect. As of MySQL 5.6.5, it           is ignored.  See the description of           ignorebuiltininnodb under           âInnoDB Command Optionsâ           earlier in this section.
