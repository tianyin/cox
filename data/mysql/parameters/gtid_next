In MySQL 5.6.11 only, you cannot execute any of the statements           CHANGE MASTER TO,           START SLAVE,           STOP SLAVE,           REPAIR TABLE,           OPTIMIZE TABLE,           ANALYZE TABLE,           CHECK TABLE,           CREATE SERVER,           ALTER SERVER,           DROP SERVER,           CACHE INDEX,           LOAD INDEX INTO           CACHE, FLUSH, or           RESET when           gtid_next is set to any value           other than AUTOMATIC; in such cases, the           statement fails with an error. Such statements are           not disallowed in MySQL 5.6.12 and later.           (Bug #16062608, Bug #16715809, Bug #69045)
