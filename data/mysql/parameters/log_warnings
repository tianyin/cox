Whether to produce additional warning messages to the error           log. This variable is enabled (1) by default and can be           disabled by setting it to 0. The server logs messages about           statements that are unsafe for statementbased logging if the           value is greater than 0. Aborted connections and accessdenied           errors for new connection attempts are logged if the value is           greater than 1.  Note that the effects of this option are not limited to           replication. It produces warnings across a spectrum of server           activities.  If a slave server was started with           logwarnings enabled, the           slave prints messages to the error log to provide information           about its status, such as the binary log and relay log           coordinates where it starts its job, when it is switching to           another relay log, when it reconnects after a disconnect, and           so forth. The server logs messages about statements that are           unsafe for statementbased logging if           logwarnings is greater than           0.
