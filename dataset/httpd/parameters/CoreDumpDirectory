CoreDumpDirectory

Description:  Directory where Apache HTTP Server attempts to
switch before dumping core 
Syntax:   CoreDumpDirectory  directory   
Default:   See usage for the default setting  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:    event  ,   prefork  ,   worker   

 This controls the directory to which Apache httpd attempts to
    switch before dumping core. If your operating system is configured to
    create core files in the working directory of the crashing process,
     CoreDumpDirectory  is necessary to change working
    directory from the default   ServerRoot  
    directory, which should not be writable by the user the server runs as. 

     If you want a core dump for debugging, you can use this directive to
    place it in a different location. This directive has no effect if your
    operating system is not configured to write core files to the working directory
    of the crashing processes. 

      Core Dumps on Linux 
       If Apache httpd starts as root and switches to another user, the
      Linux kernel  disables  core dumps even if the directory is
      writable for the process. Apache httpd (2.0.46 and later) reenables core dumps
      on Linux 2.4 and beyond, but only if you explicitly configure a  CoreDumpDirectory . 
     

     
     Core Dumps on BSD 
     To enable core-dumping of suid-executables on BSD-systems (such
    as FreeBSD), set  kern.sugid_coredump  to 1.
     
     

      Specific signals 
        CoreDumpDirectory  processing only occurs for
      a select set of fatal signals: SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGABORT,
      SIGSEGV, and SIGBUS. 
       On some operating systems, SIGQUIT also results in a core dump but
      does not go through  CoreDumpDirectory  or
       EnableExceptionHook  processing, so the core
      location is dictated entirely by the operating system.
