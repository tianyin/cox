Description:  Directory of PEM-encoded CA Certificates for
Remote Server Auth 
Syntax:   SSLProxyCACertificatePath  directory-path   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

 
This directive sets the directory where you keep the Certificates of
Certification Authorities (CAs) whose remote servers you deal with. These are used to
verify the remote server certificate on Remote Server Authentication. 
 
The files in this directory have to be PEM-encoded and are accessed through
hash filenames. So usually you can't just place the Certificate files
there: you also have to create symbolic links named
 hash-value  .N . And you should always make sure this directory
contains the appropriate symbolic links. 
  Example  SSLProxyCACertificatePath /usr/local/apache2/conf/ssl.crt/
