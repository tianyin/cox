 Minimum number of idle threads to handle request spikes.
    Different MPMs deal with this directive
    differently. 

       worker   uses a default of  MinSpareThreads
    75  and deals with idle threads on a server-wide basis. If
    there aren't enough idle threads in the server then child
    processes are created until the number of idle threads is greater
    than  number . 

       mpm_netware   uses a default of
     MinSpareThreads 10  and, since it is a single-process
    MPM, tracks this on a server-wide bases. 

       mpmt_os2   works
    similar to   mpm_netware  .  For
      mpmt_os2   the default value is  5 .
