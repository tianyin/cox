IncludeOptional

Description:  Includes other configuration files from within
the server configuration files 
Syntax:   IncludeOptional  file-path | directory-path | wildcard   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 
Compatibility:  Available in 2.3.6 and later 

 This directive allows inclusion of other configuration files
    from within the server configuration files. It works identically to the
      Include   directive, with the
    exception that if wildcards do not match any file or directory, the
      IncludeOptional   directive will be
    silently ignored instead of causing an error.
