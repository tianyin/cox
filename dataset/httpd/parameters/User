User

Description:  The userid under which the server will answer
requests 
Syntax:   User  unix-userid   
Default:   User #-1  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_unixd 

 The  User  directive sets the user ID as
    which the server will answer requests. In order to use this
    directive, the server must be run initially as  root .
    If you start the server as a non-root user, it will fail to change
    to the lesser privileged user, and will instead continue to run as
    that original user. If you do start the server as  root ,
    then it is normal for the parent process to remain running as root.
     Unix-userid  is one of: 

      A username 
       Refers to the given user by name. 

       # followed by a user number. 
       Refers to a user by its number. 
      The user should have no privileges that result in it being
    able to access files that are not intended to be visible to the
    outside world, and similarly, the user should not be able to
    execute code that is not meant for HTTP requests. It is
    recommended that you set up a new user and group specifically for
    running the server. Some admins use user  nobody , but
    this is not always desirable, since the  nobody  user
    can have other uses on the system. 

      Security 
       Don't set  User  (or   Group  ) to  root  unless
      you know exactly what you are doing, and what the dangers are.
