CacheLockMaxAge

Description:  Set the maximum possible age of a cache lock. 
Syntax:   CacheLockMaxAge  integer   
Default:   CacheLockMaxAge 5  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache 

 The  CacheLockMaxAge  directive specifies the maximum
  age of any cache lock. 

   A lock older than this value in seconds will be ignored, and the next
  incoming request will be given the opportunity to re-establish the lock.
  This mechanism prevents a slow client taking an excessively long time to refresh
  an entity.
