ScriptAlias

Description:  Maps a URL to a filesystem location and designates the
target as a CGI script 
Syntax:   ScriptAlias  URL-path 
 file-path | directory-path   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_alias 

 The  ScriptAlias  directive has the same
    behavior as the   Alias  
    directive, except that in addition it marks the target directory
    as containing CGI scripts that will be processed by   mod_cgi  's cgi-script handler. URLs with a case-sensitive
    (%-decoded) path beginning with  URL-path  will be mapped
    to scripts beginning with the second argument, which is a full
    pathname in the local filesystem. 

     ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /web/cgi-bin/ 


     A request for  http://example.com/cgi-bin/foo  would cause the
    server to run the script  /web/cgi-bin/foo .  This configuration
    is essentially equivalent to: 
     Alias /cgi-bin/ /web/cgi-bin/
< Location /cgi-bin  >
    SetHandler cgi-script
    Options +ExecCGI
< /Location > 


	  ScriptAlias  can also be used in conjunction with
	a script or handler you have. For example: 

	 ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /web/cgi-handler.pl 


     In this scenario all files requested in  /cgi-bin/  will be
    handled by the file you have configured, this allows you to use your own custom
    handler.  You may want to use this as a wrapper for CGI so that you can add
    content, or some other bespoke action. 

     It is safer to avoid placing CGI scripts under the
      DocumentRoot   in order to
    avoid accidentally revealing their source code if the
    configuration is ever changed.  The
     ScriptAlias  makes this easy by mapping a
    URL and designating CGI scripts at the same time.  If you do
    choose to place your CGI scripts in a directory already
    accessible from the web, do not use
     ScriptAlias .  Instead, use   < Directory >  ,   SetHandler  , and   Options   as in:
     < Directory /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/cgi-bin  >
    SetHandler cgi-script
    Options ExecCGI
< /Directory > 

    This is necessary since multiple  URL-paths  can map
    to the same filesystem location, potentially bypassing the
     ScriptAlias  and revealing the source code
    of the CGI scripts if they are not restricted by a
      Directory   section.
