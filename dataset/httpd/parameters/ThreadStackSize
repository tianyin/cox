ThreadStackSize

Description:  The size in bytes of the stack used by threads handling
client connections 
Syntax:   ThreadStackSize  size   
Default:   65536 on NetWare; varies on other operating systems  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:    event  ,   mpm_netware  ,   mpmt_os2  ,   mpm_winnt  ,   worker  ,   event   
Compatibility:  Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.1 and later 

 The  ThreadStackSize  directive sets the
    size of the stack (for autodata) of threads which handle client
    connections and call modules to help process those connections.
    In most cases the operating system default for stack size is
    reasonable, but there are some conditions where it may need to be
    adjusted: 

      On platforms with a relatively small default thread stack size
      (e.g., HP-UX), Apache httpd may crash when using some third-party modules
      which use a relatively large amount of autodata storage.  Those
      same modules may have worked fine on other platforms where the
      default thread stack size is larger.  This type of crash is
      resolved by setting  ThreadStackSize  to a
      value higher than the operating system default.  This type of
      adjustment is necessary only if the provider of the third-party
      module specifies that it is required, or if diagnosis of an Apache httpd
      crash indicates that the thread stack size was too small. 

       On platforms where the default thread stack size is
      significantly larger than necessary for the web server
      configuration, a higher number of threads per child process
      will be achievable if  ThreadStackSize  is
      set to a value lower than the operating system default.  This type
      of adjustment should only be made in a test environment which allows
      the full set of web server processing can be exercised, as there
      may be infrequent requests which require more stack to process.
      The minimum required stack size strongly depends on the modules
      used, but any change in the web server configuration can invalidate
      the current  ThreadStackSize  setting. 

       On Linux, this directive can only be used to increase the default
      stack size, as the underlying system call uses the value as a
       minimum  stack size.  The (often large) soft limit for
       ulimit -s  (8MB if unlimited) is used as the default stack
      size. 
      It is recommended to not reduce  ThreadStackSize 
    unless a high number of threads per child process is needed. On some
    platforms (including Linux), a setting of 128000 is already too low and
    causes crashes with some common modules.
