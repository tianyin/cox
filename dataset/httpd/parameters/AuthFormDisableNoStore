Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_auth_form 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.3.0 and later 

 The   AuthFormDisableNoStore   flag
    disables the sending of a  Cache-Control no-store  header with the
    error 401 page returned when the user is not yet logged in. The purpose of the header
    is to make it difficult for an  ecmascript  application to attempt to resubmit the
    login form, and reveal the username and password to the backend application. Disable
    at your own risk.
