AuthLDAPCompareAsUser

Description:  Use the authenticated user's credentials to perform authorization comparisons 
Syntax:   AuthLDAPCompareAsUser on|off  
Default:   AuthLDAPCompareAsUser off  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_authnz_ldap 
Compatibility:  Available in version 2.3.6 and later 

 When set, and   mod_authnz_ldap   has authenticated the
    user, LDAP comparisons for authorization use the queried distinguished name (DN)
    and HTTP basic authentication password of the authenticated user instead of
    the servers configured credentials. 

      The  ldap-attribute ,  ldap-user , and  ldap-group  (single-level only)
    authorization checks use comparisons. 

     This directive only has effect on the comparisons performed during
    nested group processing when   
    AuthLDAPSearchAsUser   is also enabled. 

      This directive should only be used when your LDAP server doesn't
        accept anonymous comparisons and you cannot use a dedicated
          AuthLDAPBindDN  .
