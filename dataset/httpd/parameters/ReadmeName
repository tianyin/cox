ReadmeName

Description:  Name of the file that will be inserted at the end
of the index listing 
Syntax:   ReadmeName  filename   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  Indexes 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_autoindex 

 The  ReadmeName  directive sets the name
    of the file that will be appended to the end of the index
    listing.  Filename  is the name of the file to include, and
    is taken to be relative to the location being indexed. If
     Filename  begins with a slash, as in example 2, it will be taken to be
    relative to the   DocumentRoot  .
     

     # Example 1
ReadmeName FOOTER.html 


     # Example 2
ReadmeName /include/FOOTER.html 


     See also   HeaderName  , where this behavior is described in greater
    detail.
