AuthUserFile

Description:  Sets the name of a text file containing the list of users and
passwords for authentication 
Syntax:   AuthUserFile  file-path   
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_authn_file 

 The  AuthUserFile  directive sets the name
    of a textual file containing the list of users and passwords for
    user authentication.  File-path  is the path to the user
    file. If it is not absolute, it is treated as relative to the
      ServerRoot  . 

     Each line of the user file contains a username followed by
    a colon, followed by the encrypted password. If the same user
    ID is defined multiple times,   mod_authn_file   will
    use the first occurrence to verify the password. 

     The encrypted password format depends on which authentication
    frontend (e.g.   mod_auth_basic   or
      mod_auth_digest  ) is being used.  See  Password Formats  for
    more information. 

     For   mod_auth_basic  , use the utility   htpasswd  
    which is installed as part of the binary distribution, or which
    can be found in  src/support . See the
     man page  for more details.
    In short: 

     Create a password file  Filename  with
     username  as the initial ID. It will prompt for
    the password: 

       
      htpasswd -c Filename username
       

     Add or modify  username2  in the password file
     Filename : 

       
      htpasswd Filename username2
       

     Note that searching large text files is  very 
    inefficient;   AuthDBMUserFile   should be used
    instead. 

     For   mod_auth_digest  , use   htdigest  
    instead. Note that you cannot mix user data for Digest Authentication
    and Basic Authentication within the same file. 

      Security 
       Make sure that the  AuthUserFile  is
      stored outside the document tree of the web-server. Do
       not  put it in the directory that it protects.
      Otherwise, clients may be able to download the
       AuthUserFile .
