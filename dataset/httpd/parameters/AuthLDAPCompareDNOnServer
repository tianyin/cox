AuthLDAPCompareDNOnServer

Description:  Use the LDAP server to compare the DNs 
Syntax:   AuthLDAPCompareDNOnServer on|off  
Default:   AuthLDAPCompareDNOnServer on  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_authnz_ldap 

 When set,   mod_authnz_ldap   will use the LDAP
    server to compare the DNs. This is the only foolproof way to
    compare DNs.    mod_authnz_ldap   will search the
    directory for the DN specified with the   Require dn   directive, then,
    retrieve the DN and compare it with the DN retrieved from the user
    entry. If this directive is not set,
      mod_authnz_ldap   simply does a string comparison. It
    is possible to get false negatives with this approach, but it is
    much faster. Note the   mod_ldap   cache can speed up
    DN comparison in most situations.
