SSLFIPS

Description:  SSL FIPS mode Switch 
Syntax:   SSLFIPS on|off  
Default:   SSLFIPS off  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

 
This directive toggles the usage of the SSL library FIPS_mode flag.
It must be set in the global server context and cannot be configured
with conflicting settings (SSLFIPS on followed by SSLFIPS off or
similar).  The mode applies to all SSL library operations.
 
 
If httpd was compiled against an SSL library which did not support
the FIPS_mode flag,  SSLFIPS on  will fail.  Refer to the
FIPS 140-2 Security Policy document of the SSL provider library for
specific requirements to use mod_ssl in a FIPS 140-2 approved mode
of operation; note that mod_ssl itself is not validated, but may be
described as using FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module, when
all components are assembled and operated under the guidelines imposed
by the applicable Security Policy.
