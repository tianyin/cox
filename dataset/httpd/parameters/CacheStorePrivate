CacheStorePrivate

Description:  Attempt to cache responses that the server has marked as private 
Syntax:   CacheStorePrivate On|Off  
Default:   CacheStorePrivate Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache 

 Ordinarily, responses with Cache-Control: private header values will not
       be stored in the cache.  The  CacheStorePrivate 
       directive allows this behavior to be overridden.
        CacheStorePrivate  On
       tells the server to attempt to cache the resource even if it contains
       private header values.  Resources requiring authorization will
        never  be cached. 

     CacheStorePrivate On 


      Warning: 
       This directive will allow caching even if the upstream server has
       requested that the resource not be cached.  This directive is only
       ideal for a 'private' cache.
