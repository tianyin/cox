ProxySet

Description:  Set various Proxy balancer or member parameters 
Syntax:   ProxySet  url   key=value [key=value ...]   
Context:  directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 
Compatibility:  ProxySet is only available in Apache HTTP Server 2.2
  and later. 

 This directive is used as an alternate method of setting any of the
    parameters available to Proxy balancers and workers normally done via the
      ProxyPass   directive. If used
    within a  < Proxy  balancer url|worker url  > 
    container directive, the  url  argument is not required. As a side
    effect the respective balancer or worker gets created. This can be useful
    when doing reverse proxying via a
      RewriteRule   instead of a
      ProxyPass   directive. 

      < Proxy balancer://hotcluster >
    BalancerMember http://www2.example.com:8080 loadfactor=1
    BalancerMember http://www3.example.com:8080 loadfactor=2
    ProxySet lbmethod=bytraffic
< /Proxy > 
 

     < Proxy http://backend >
    ProxySet keepalive=On
< /Proxy > 


     ProxySet balancer://foo lbmethod=bytraffic timeout=15 


     ProxySet ajp://backend:7001 timeout=15 


     Warning 
       Keep in mind that the same parameter key can have a different meaning
      depending whether it is applied to a balancer or a worker as shown by the two
      examples above regarding timeout.
