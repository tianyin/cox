ProxyFtpListOnWildcard

Description:  Whether wildcards in requested filenames trigger a file listing 
Syntax:   ProxyFtpListOnWildcard [on|off]  
Default:   on  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy_ftp 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache 2.3.3 and later 

 The  ProxyFtpListOnWildcard  directive
    controls whether wildcard characters ("*?[{~") in requested
    filenames cause   mod_proxy_ftp   to return a listing
    of files instead of downloading a file.  By default (value on),
    they do.  Set to "off" to allow downloading files even if they
    have wildcard characters in their names.
