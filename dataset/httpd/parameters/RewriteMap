RewriteMap

Description:  Defines a mapping function for key-lookup 
Syntax:   RewriteMap  MapName   MapType : MapSource 
  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_rewrite 

 The  RewriteMap  directive defines a
       Rewriting Map  which can be used inside rule
      substitution strings by the mapping-functions to
      insert/substitute fields through a key lookup. The source of
      this lookup can be of various types. 

       The   MapName   is
      the name of the map and will be used to specify a
      mapping-function for the substitution strings of a rewriting
      rule via one of the following constructs: 

       
          ${   MapName   : 
         LookupKey   }   ${   MapName   : 
         LookupKey   |   DefaultValue 
         }  
       

       When such a construct occurs, the map  MapName  is
      consulted and the key  LookupKey  is looked-up. If the
      key is found, the map-function construct is substituted by
       SubstValue . If the key is not found then it is
      substituted by  DefaultValue  or by the empty string
      if no  DefaultValue  was specified. Empty values
      behave as if the key was absent, therefore it is not possible
      to distinguish between empty-valued keys and absent keys. 

       For example, you might define a
       RewriteMap  as: 

       RewriteMap examplemap txt:/path/to/file/map.txt 


       You would then be able to use this map in a
       RewriteRule  as follows: 

       RewriteRule ^/ex/(.*) ${examplemap:$1} 


       The following combinations for  MapType  and
       MapSource  can be used: 

      txt 
         A plain text file containing space-separated key-value
        pairs, one per line. ( Details ... ) 

     rnd 
         Randomly selects an entry from a plain text file ( Details ... ) 

     dbm 
         Looks up an entry in a dbm file containing name, value
        pairs. Hash is constructed from a plain text file format using
        the   httxt2dbm  
        utility.  ( Details ... ) 

     int 
         One of the four available internal functions provided by
         RewriteMap : toupper, tolower, escape or
        unescape. ( Details ... ) 

     prg 
         Calls an external program or script to process the
        rewriting. ( Details ... ) 

     dbd or fastdbd 
         A SQL SELECT statement to be performed to look up the
        rewrite target. ( Details ... )
