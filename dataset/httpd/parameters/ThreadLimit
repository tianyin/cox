ThreadLimit

Description:  Sets the upper limit on the configurable number of threads
per child process 
Syntax:   ThreadLimit  number   
Default:   See usage for details  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:    event  ,   mpm_winnt  ,   worker   

 This directive sets the maximum configured value for   ThreadsPerChild   for the lifetime
    of the Apache httpd process.  Any attempts to change this directive
    during a restart will be ignored, but   ThreadsPerChild   can be modified
    during a restart up to the value of this directive. 

     Special care must be taken when using this directive.  If
     ThreadLimit  is set to a value much higher
    than   ThreadsPerChild  ,
    extra unused shared memory will be allocated.  If both
     ThreadLimit  and   ThreadsPerChild   are set to values
    higher than the system can handle, Apache httpd may not start or the
    system may become unstable. Do not set the value of this directive
    any higher than your greatest predicted setting of   ThreadsPerChild   for the
    current run of Apache httpd. 

     The default value for  ThreadLimit  is
     1920  when used with   mpm_winnt   and
     64  when used with the others. 

      Note 
       There is a hard limit of  ThreadLimit 20000  (or
       ThreadLimit 100000  with   event  ,
       ThreadLimit 15000  with   mpm_winnt  )
      compiled into the server. This is intended to avoid nasty effects
      caused by typos. To increase it even further past this limit, you
      will need to modify the value of MAX_THREAD_LIMIT in the mpm
      source file and rebuild the server.
