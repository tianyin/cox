SSLCARevocationCheck

Description:  Enable CRL-based revocation checking 
Syntax:   SSLCARevocationCheck chain|leaf|none  
Default:   SSLCARevocationCheck none  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

 
Enables certificate revocation list (CRL) checking. At least one of
  SSLCARevocationFile  
or   SSLCARevocationPath   must be
configured. When set to  chain  (recommended setting),
CRL checks are applied to all certificates in the chain, while setting it to
 leaf  limits the checks to the end-entity cert.
 
 
 When set to  chain  or  leaf ,
CRLs  must  be available for successful validation 
 
Prior to version 2.3.15, CRL checking in mod_ssl also succeeded when
no CRL(s) were found in any of the locations configured with
  SSLCARevocationFile  
or   SSLCARevocationPath  .
With the introduction of this directive, the behavior has been changed:
when checking is enabled, CRLs  must  be present for the validation
to succeed - otherwise it will fail with an
 "unable to get certificate CRL"  error.
