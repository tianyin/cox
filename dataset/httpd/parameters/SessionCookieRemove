SessionCookieRemove

Description:  Control for whether session cookies should be removed from incoming HTTP headers 
Syntax:   SessionCookieRemove On|Off  
Default:   SessionCookieRemove Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_session_cookie 

 The  SessionCookieRemove  flag controls whether the cookies
    containing the session will be removed from the headers during request processing. 

     In a reverse proxy situation where the Apache server acts as a server frontend for
    a backend origin server, revealing the contents of the session cookie to the backend
    could be a potential privacy violation. When set to on, the session cookie will be
    removed from the incoming HTTP headers.
