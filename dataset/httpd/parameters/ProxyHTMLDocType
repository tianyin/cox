ProxyHTMLDocType

Description:  Sets an HTML or XHTML document type declaration. 
Syntax:   ProxyHTMLDocType  HTML|XHTML [Legacy]   OR 
 ProxyHTMLDocType  fpi [SGML|XML]   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_proxy_html 
Compatibility:  Version 2.4 and later; available as a third-party

 In the first form, documents will be declared as HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0
according to the option selected.  This option also determines whether
HTML or XHTML syntax is used for output.   Note that the format of the
documents coming from the backend server is immaterial: the parser will
deal with it automatically.  If the optional second argument is set to
"Legacy", documents will be declared "Transitional", an option that may
be necessary if you are proxying pre-1998 content or working with defective
authoring/publishing tools. 
 In the second form, it will insert your own FPI.  The optional second
argument determines whether SGML/HTML or XML/XHTML syntax will be used. 
 The default is changed to omitting any FPI,
on the grounds that no FPI is better than a bogus one.  If your backend
generates decent HTML or XHTML, set it accordingly. 
 If the first form is used, mod_proxy_html
will also clean up the HTML to the specified standard.  It cannot
fix every error, but it will strip out bogus elements and attributes.
It will also optionally log other errors at   LogLevel   Debug.
