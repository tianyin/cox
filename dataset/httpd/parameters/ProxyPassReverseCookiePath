ProxyPassReverseCookiePath

Description:  Adjusts the Path string in Set-Cookie headers from a reverse-
proxied server 
Syntax:   ProxyPassReverseCookiePath  internal-path 
 public-path  [ interpolate ]  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 

 
Useful in conjunction with
  ProxyPassReverse  
in situations where backend URL paths are mapped to public paths on the
reverse proxy. This directive rewrites the  path  string in
 Set-Cookie  headers. If the beginning of the cookie path matches
 internal-path , the cookie path will be replaced with
 public-path .
  
In the example given with 
  ProxyPassReverse  , the directive:
 
     ProxyPassReverseCookiePath  /  /mirror/foo/ 

 
will rewrite a cookie with backend path  /  (or
 /example  or, in fact, anything) to  /mirror/foo/ .
