LDAPTrustedMode

Description:  Specifies the SSL/TLS mode to be used when connecting to an LDAP server. 
Syntax:   LDAPTrustedMode  type   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ldap 

 The following modes are supported: 
      NONE - no encryption 
       SSL - ldaps:// encryption on default port 636 
       TLS - STARTTLS encryption on default port 389 
      Not all LDAP toolkits support all the above modes. An error message
    will be logged at runtime if a mode is not supported, and the
    connection to the LDAP server will fail.
     

     If an ldaps:// URL is specified, the mode becomes SSL and the setting
    of LDAPTrustedMode is ignored.
