BufferedLogs

Description:  Buffer log entries in memory before writing to disk 
Syntax:   BufferedLogs On|Off  
Default:   BufferedLogs Off  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_log_config 

 The  BufferedLogs  directive causes
      mod_log_config   to store several log entries in
    memory and write them together to disk, rather than writing them
    after each request.  On some systems, this may result in more
    efficient disk access and hence higher performance.  It may be
    set only once for the entire server; it cannot be configured
    per virtual-host. 

     This directive should be used with caution as a crash might
    cause loss of logging data.
