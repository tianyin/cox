DavMinTimeout

Description:  Minimum amount of time the server holds a lock on
a DAV resource 
Syntax:   DavMinTimeout  seconds   
Default:   DavMinTimeout 0  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_dav 

 When a client requests a DAV resource lock, it can also
    specify a time when the lock will be automatically removed by
    the server. This value is only a request, and the server can
    ignore it or inform the client of an arbitrary value. 

     Use the  DavMinTimeout  directive to specify, in
    seconds, the minimum lock timeout to return to a client.
    Microsoft Web Folders defaults to a timeout of 120 seconds; the
     DavMinTimeout  can override this to a higher value
    (like 600 seconds) to reduce the chance of the client losing
    the lock due to network latency. 

      Example  < Location /MSWord >
    DavMinTimeout 600
< /Location >
