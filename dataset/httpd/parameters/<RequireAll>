<RequireAll>

Description:  Enclose a group of authorization directives of which none
must fail and at least one must succeed for the enclosing directive to
succeed. 
Syntax:   < RequireAll > ... < /RequireAll >  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_authz_core 

  < RequireAll >  and
     < /RequireAll >  are used to enclose a group of
    authorization directives of which none must fail and at least one
    must succeed in order for
    the  < RequireAll >  directive to
    succeed. 

     If none of the directives contained within the
     < RequireAll >  directive fails,
    and at least one succeeds, then the
     < RequireAll >  directive
    succeeds.  If none succeed and none fail, then it returns a
    neutral result.  In all other cases, it fails.
