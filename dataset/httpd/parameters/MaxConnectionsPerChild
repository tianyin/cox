MaxConnectionsPerChild

Description:  Limit on the number of connections that an individual child server
will handle during its life 
Syntax:   MaxConnectionsPerChild  number   
Default:   MaxConnectionsPerChild 0  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:    event  ,   mpm_netware  ,   mpm_winnt  ,   mpmt_os2  ,   prefork  ,   worker   
Compatibility:  Available Apache HTTP Server 2.3.9 and later. The old name
 MaxRequestsPerChild  is still supported. 

 The  MaxConnectionsPerChild  directive sets
    the limit on the number of connections that an individual child
    server process will handle. After
     MaxConnectionsPerChild  connections, the child
    process will die. If  MaxConnectionsPerChild  is
     0 , then the process will never expire. 

     Setting  MaxConnectionsPerChild  to a
    non-zero value limits the amount of memory that process can consume
    by (accidental) memory leakage.
