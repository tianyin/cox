ErrorLog

Description:  Location where the server will log errors 
Syntax:    ErrorLog  file-path |syslog[: facility ]  
Default:   ErrorLog logs/error_log (Unix) ErrorLog logs/error.log (Windows and OS/2)  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 The  ErrorLog  directive sets the name of
    the file to which the server will log any errors it encounters. If
    the  file-path  is not absolute then it is assumed to be
    relative to the   ServerRoot  . 

     ErrorLog "/var/log/httpd/error_log" 


     If the  file-path 
    begins with a pipe character " | " then it is assumed to be a
    command to spawn to handle the error log. 

     ErrorLog "|/usr/local/bin/httpd_errors" 


     See the notes on  piped logs  for
    more information. 

     Using  syslog  instead of a filename enables logging
    via syslogd(8) if the system supports it. The default is to use
    syslog facility  local7 , but you can override this by
    using the  syslog: facility   syntax where
     facility  can be one of the names usually documented in
    syslog(1).  The facility is effectively global, and if it is changed
    in individual virtual hosts, the final facility specified affects the
    entire server. 

     ErrorLog syslog:user 


     SECURITY: See the  security tips 
    document for details on why your security could be compromised
    if the directory where log files are stored is writable by
    anyone other than the user that starts the server. 
      Note 
       When entering a file path on non-Unix platforms, care should be taken
      to make sure that only forward slashes are used even though the platform
      may allow the use of back slashes. In general it is a good idea to always
      use forward slashes throughout the configuration files.
