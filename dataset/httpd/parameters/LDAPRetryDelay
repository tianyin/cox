LDAPRetryDelay

Description:  Configures the delay between LDAP server retries. 
Syntax:   LDAPRetryDelay  seconds   
Default:   LDAPRetryDelay 0  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ldap 

 If  LDAPRetryDelay  is set to a non-zero
    value, the server will delay retrying an LDAP request for the
    specified amount of time.  Setting this directive to 0 will
    result in any retry to occur without delay. 

     LDAP errors such as timeouts and refused connections are retryable.
