VHostCGIMode

Description:  Determines whether the virtualhost can run
subprocesses, and the privileges available to subprocesses. 
Syntax:   VHostCGIMode On|Off|Secure  
Default:   VHostCGIMode On  
Context:  virtual host 
Status:  Experimental 
Module:  mod_privileges 
Compatibility:  Available on Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris with
non-threaded MPMs (  prefork   or custom MPM). 

 Determines whether the virtual host is allowed to run fork and exec,
    the  privileges  required to run subprocesses.  If this is set to
     Off  the virtualhost is denied the privileges and will not
    be able to run traditional CGI programs or scripts under the traditional
      mod_cgi  , nor similar external programs such as those
    created by   mod_ext_filter   or
      RewriteMap    prog .
    Note that it does not prevent CGI programs running under alternative
    process and security models such as  mod_fcgid , which is a recommended solution in Solaris. 
     If set to  On  or  Secure , the virtual host
    is permitted to run external programs and scripts as above.
    Setting  VHostCGIMode   Secure  has
    the effect of denying privileges to the subprocesses, as described
    for  VHostSecure .
