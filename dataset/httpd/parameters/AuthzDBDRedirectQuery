AuthzDBDRedirectQuery

Description:  Specify a query to look up a login page for the user 
Syntax:   AuthzDBDRedirectQuery  query   
Context:  directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_authz_dbd 

 Specifies an optional SQL query to use after successful login
    (or logout) to redirect the user to a URL, which may be
    specific to the user.  The user's ID will be passed as a single string
    parameter when the SQL query is executed.  It may be referenced within
    the query statement using a  %s  format specifier. 
     AuthzDBDRedirectQuery "SELECT userpage FROM userpages WHERE user = %s" 

     The first column value of the first row returned by the query
    statement should be a string containing a URL to which to redirect
    the client.  Subsequent rows will be ignored.  If no rows are returned,
    the client will not be redirected. 
     Note that  AuthzDBDLoginToReferer  takes
    precedence if both are set.
