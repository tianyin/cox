<RequireNone>

Description:  Enclose a group of authorization directives of which none
must succeed for the enclosing directive to not fail. 
Syntax:   < RequireNone > ... < /RequireNone >  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_authz_core 

  < RequireNone >  and
     < /RequireNone >  are used to enclose a group of
    authorization directives of which none must succeed
    in order for the
     < RequireNone >  directive to
    not fail. 

     If one or more of the directives contained within the
     < RequireNone >  directive succeed,
    then the  < RequireNone >  directive
    fails.  In all other cases, it returns a neutral result.  Thus as with
    the other negated authorization directive  Require not ,
    it can never independently
    authorize a request because it can never return a successful result.
    It can be used, however, to restrict the set of users who are
    authorized to access a resource. 

     Because negated authorization directives are unable to
    return a successful result, they can not significantly influence
    the result of a  < RequireNone > 
    directive.  Therefore negated authorization directives
    are not permitted within a
     < RequireNone >  directive.
