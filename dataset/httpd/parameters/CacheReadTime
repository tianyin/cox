CacheReadTime

Description:  The minimum time (in milliseconds) that should elapse while reading
  before data is sent downstream 
Syntax:   CacheReadTime  milliseconds   
Default:   CacheReadTime 0  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache_disk 

 The  CacheReadTime  directive sets the minimum amount
    of elapsed time that should pass before making an attempt to send data
    downstream to the client. During the time period, data will be buffered
    before sending the result to the client. This can improve performance when
    caching content from a reverse proxy. 

     The default of zero disables this option. 

     This directive only takes effect when the data is being saved to the
    cache, as opposed to data being served from the cache. It is recommended
    that this option be used alongside the
      CacheReadSize   directive to
    ensure that the server does not buffer excessively should data arrive faster
    than expected.
