Syntax:   SessionDBDCookieRemove On|Off

 The  SessionDBDCookieRemove  flag controls whether the cookies
    containing the session ID will be removed from the headers during request processing. 

     In a reverse proxy situation where the Apache server acts as a server frontend for
    a backend origin server, revealing the contents of the session ID cookie to the backend
    could be a potential privacy violation. When set to on, the session ID cookie will be
    removed from the incoming HTTP headers.
