LDAPTrustedGlobalCert

Description:  Sets the file or database containing global trusted
Certificate Authority or global client certificates 
Syntax:   LDAPTrustedGlobalCert  type   directory-path/filename   [password]   
Context:  server config 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ldap 

 It specifies the directory path and file name of the trusted CA
    certificates and/or system wide client certificates   mod_ldap  
    should use when establishing an SSL or TLS connection to an LDAP
    server. Note that all certificate information specified using this directive
    is applied globally to the entire server installation. Some LDAP toolkits
    (notably Novell) require all client certificates to be set globally using
    this directive. Most other toolkits require clients certificates to be set
    per Directory or per Location using LDAPTrustedClientCert. If you get this
    wrong, an error may be logged when an attempt is made to contact the LDAP
    server, or the connection may silently fail (See the SSL/TLS certificate
    guide above for details).
    The type specifies the kind of certificate parameter being
    set, depending on the LDAP toolkit being used. Supported types are: 
      CA_DER - binary DER encoded CA certificate 
       CA_BASE64 - PEM encoded CA certificate 
       CA_CERT7_DB - Netscape cert7.db CA certificate database file 
       CA_SECMOD - Netscape secmod database file 
       CERT_DER - binary DER encoded client certificate 
       CERT_BASE64 - PEM encoded client certificate 
       CERT_KEY3_DB - Netscape key3.db client certificate database file 
       CERT_NICKNAME - Client certificate "nickname" (Netscape SDK) 
       CERT_PFX - PKCS#12 encoded client certificate (Novell SDK) 
       KEY_DER - binary DER encoded private key 
       KEY_BASE64 - PEM encoded private key 
       KEY_PFX - PKCS#12 encoded private key (Novell SDK)
