SessionCryptoDriver

Description:  The crypto driver to be used to encrypt the session 
Syntax:   SessionCryptoDriver  name   [param[=value]]   
Default:   none  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Experimental 
Module:  mod_session_crypto 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache 2.3.0 and later 

 The  SessionCryptoDriver  directive specifies the name of
    the crypto driver to be used for encryption. If not specified, the driver defaults
    to the recommended driver compiled into APR-util. 

     The  NSS  crypto driver requires some parameters for configuration,
    which are specified as parameters with optional values after the driver name. 

      NSS without a certificate database  SessionCryptoDriver nss 
 

      NSS with certificate database  SessionCryptoDriver nss dir=certs 
 

      NSS with certificate database and parameters  SessionCryptoDriver nss dir=certs key3=key3.db cert7=cert7.db secmod=secmod 
 

      NSS with paths containing spaces  SessionCryptoDriver nss "dir=My Certs" key3=key3.db cert7=cert7.db secmod=secmod 
 

     The  NSS  crypto driver might have already been
    configured by another part of the server, for example from
     mod_nss  or   mod_ldap  . If found to
    have already been configured, a warning will be logged, and the
    existing configuration will have taken affect.  To avoid this
    warning, use the noinit parameter as follows. 

      NSS with certificate database  SessionCryptoDriver nss noinit 
 

     To prevent confusion, ensure that all modules requiring NSS are configured with
    identical parameters. 

     The  openssl  crypto driver supports an optional parameter to specify
    the engine to be used for encryption. 

      OpenSSL with engine support  SessionCryptoDriver openssl engine=name
