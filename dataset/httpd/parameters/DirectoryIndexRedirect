DirectoryIndexRedirect

Description:  Configures an external redirect for directory indexes.
 
Syntax:   DirectoryIndexRedirect on | off | permanent | temp | seeother |
 3xx-code 
  
Default:   DirectoryIndexRedirect off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  Indexes 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_dir 
Compatibility:  Available in version 2.3.14 and later 

 By default, the  DirectoryIndex  is selected
    and returned transparently to the client.   DirectoryIndexRedirect  causes an external redirect
    to instead be issued. 

     The argument can be: 
       on : issues a 302 redirection to the index resource. 
       off : does not issue a redirection. This is the legacy behaviour of mod_dir. 
       permanent : issues a 301 (permanent) redirection to the index resource. 
       temp : this has the same effect as  on  
       seeother : issues a 303 redirection (also known as "See Other") to the index resource. 
       3xx-code : issues a redirection marked by the chosen 3xx code. 
       Example  DirectoryIndexRedirect on 
 

     A request for  http://example.com/docs/  would
    return a temporary redirect to  http://example.com/docs/index.html 
    if it exists.
