ErrorDocument

Description:  What the server will return to the client
in case of an error 
Syntax:   ErrorDocument  error-code   document   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 In the event of a problem or error, Apache httpd can be configured
    to do one of four things, 

      output a simple hardcoded error message 

       output a customized message 

       internally redirect to a local  URL-path  to handle the
      problem/error 

       redirect to an external  URL  to handle the
      problem/error 
      The first option is the default, while options 2-4 are
    configured using the  ErrorDocument 
    directive, which is followed by the HTTP response code and a URL
    or a message. Apache httpd will sometimes offer additional information
    regarding the problem/error. 

     URLs can begin with a slash (/) for local web-paths (relative
    to the   DocumentRoot  ), or be a
    full URL which the client can resolve. Alternatively, a message
    can be provided to be displayed by the browser. Examples: 

     ErrorDocument 500 http://foo.example.com/cgi-bin/tester
ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/bad_urls.pl
ErrorDocument 401 /subscription_info.html
ErrorDocument 403 "Sorry can't allow you access today"
ErrorDocument 403 Forbidden! 


     Additionally, the special value  default  can be used
    to specify Apache httpd's simple hardcoded message.  While not required
    under normal circumstances,  default  will restore
    Apache httpd's simple hardcoded message for configurations that would
    otherwise inherit an existing  ErrorDocument . 

     ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/bad_urls.pl

< Directory /web/docs >
  ErrorDocument 404 default
< /Directory > 


     Note that when you specify an  ErrorDocument 
    that points to a remote URL (ie. anything with a method such as
     http  in front of it), Apache HTTP Server will send a redirect to the
    client to tell it where to find the document, even if the
    document ends up being on the same server. This has several
    implications, the most important being that the client will not
    receive the original error status code, but instead will
    receive a redirect status code. This in turn can confuse web
    robots and other clients which try to determine if a URL is
    valid using the status code. In addition, if you use a remote
    URL in an  ErrorDocument 401 , the client will not
    know to prompt the user for a password since it will not
    receive the 401 status code. Therefore,  if you use an
     ErrorDocument 401  directive then it must refer to a local
    document.  

     Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE) will by default ignore
    server-generated error messages when they are "too small" and substitute
    its own "friendly" error messages. The size threshold varies depending on
    the type of error, but in general, if you make your error document
    greater than 512 bytes, then MSIE will show the server-generated
    error rather than masking it.  More information is available in
    Microsoft Knowledge Base article  Q294807 . 

     Although most error messages can be overridden, there are certain
    circumstances where the internal messages are used regardless of the
    setting of   ErrorDocument  .  In
    particular, if a malformed request is detected, normal request processing
    will be immediately halted and the internal error message returned.
    This is necessary to guard against security problems caused by
    bad requests. 

     If you are using mod_proxy, you may wish to enable
      ProxyErrorOverride   so that you can provide
    custom error messages on behalf of your Origin servers. If you don't enable ProxyErrorOverride,
    Apache httpd will not generate custom error documents for proxied content.
