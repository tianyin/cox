AuthFormSize

Description:  The largest size of the form in bytes that will be parsed for the login details 
Syntax:   AuthFormSize  size   
Default:   8192  
Context:  directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_auth_form 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.3.0 and later 

 The   AuthFormSize   directive specifies
    the maximum size of the body of the request that will be parsed to find the login form. 

     If a login request arrives that exceeds this size, the whole request will be aborted
    with the HTTP response code  HTTP_REQUEST_TOO_LARGE . 

     If you have populated the form with fields described by
      AuthFormMethod  ,
      AuthFormMimetype   and
      AuthFormBody  , you probably want to set this
    field to a similar size as the   KeptBodySize  
    directive.
