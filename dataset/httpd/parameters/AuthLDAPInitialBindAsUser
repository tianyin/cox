AuthLDAPInitialBindAsUser

Description:  Determines if the server does the initial DN lookup using the basic authentication users'
own username, instead of anonymously or with hard-coded credentials for the server 
Syntax:   AuthLDAPInitialBindAsUser  off|on   
Default:   AuthLDAPInitialBindAsUser off  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_authnz_ldap 
Compatibility:  Available in version 2.3.6 and later 

 By default, the server either anonymously, or with a dedicated user and
     password, converts the basic authentication username into an LDAP
     distinguished name (DN).  This directive forces the server to use the verbatim username
     and password provided by the incoming user to perform the initial DN
     search. 

       If the verbatim username can't directly bind, but needs some
     cosmetic transformation, see   
     AuthLDAPInitialBindPattern  . 

       This directive should only be used when your LDAP server doesn't
         accept anonymous searches and you cannot use a dedicated
           AuthLDAPBindDN  .
      

       Not available with authorization-only 
         This directive can only be used if this module authenticates the user, and
         has no effect when this module is used exclusively for authorization.
