ProxyErrorOverride

Description:  Override error pages for proxied content 
Syntax:   ProxyErrorOverride On|Off  
Default:   ProxyErrorOverride Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 

 This directive is useful for reverse-proxy setups, where you want to
    have a common look and feel on the error pages seen by the end user.
    This also allows for included files (via
      mod_include  's SSI) to get
    the error code and act accordingly (default behavior would display
    the error page of the proxied server, turning this on shows the SSI
    Error message). 

     This directive does not affect the processing of informational (1xx),
    normal success (2xx), or redirect (3xx) responses.
