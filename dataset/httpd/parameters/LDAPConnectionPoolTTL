LDAPConnectionPoolTTL

Description:  Discard backend connections that have been sitting in the connection pool too long 
Syntax:   LDAPConnectionPoolTTL  n   
Default:   LDAPConnectionPoolTTL -1  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ldap 
Compatibility:  Apache HTTP Server 2.3.12 and later 

 Specifies the maximum age, in seconds, that a pooled LDAP connection can remain idle
    and still be available for use.  Connections are cleaned up when they are next needed,
    not asynchronously. 

     A setting of 0 causes connections to never be saved in the backend
    connection pool.  The default value of -1, and any other negative value,
     allows connections of any age to be reused. 

     The timemout is based on when the LDAP connection is returned to the
    pool, not based on the last time I/O has been performed over the backend
    connection.  If the information is cached, the apparent idle time can exceed
    the  LDAPConnectionPoolTTL .  

      This timeout defaults to units of seconds, but accepts
    suffixes for milliseconds (ms), minutes (min), and hours (h).
