Satisfy

Description:  Interaction between host-level access control and
user authentication 
Syntax:   Satisfy Any|All  
Default:   Satisfy All  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_access_compat 
Compatibility:  Influenced by   < Limit >   and   < LimitExcept >   in version 2.0.51 and
later 

 Access policy if both   Allow   and   Require   used. The parameter can be
    either  All  or  Any . This directive is only
    useful if access to a particular area is being restricted by both
    username/password  and  client host address. In this case
    the default behavior ( All ) is to require that the client
    passes the address access restriction  and  enters a valid
    username and password. With the  Any  option the client will be
    granted access if they either pass the host restriction or enter a
    valid username and password. This can be used to password restrict
    an area, but to let clients from particular addresses in without
    prompting for a password. 

     For example, if you wanted to let people on your network have
    unrestricted access to a portion of your website, but require that
    people outside of your network provide a password, you could use a
    configuration similar to the following: 

     Require valid-user
Allow from 192.168.1
Satisfy Any 


     
    Another frequent use of the  Satisfy  directive
    is to relax access restrictions for a subdirectory:
     

     < Directory /var/www/private >
    Require valid-user
< /Directory >

< Directory /var/www/private/public >
    Allow from all
    Satisfy Any
< /Directory > 


     In the above example, authentication will be required for the
     /var/www/private  directory, but will not be required
    for the  /var/www/private/public  directory. 

     Since version 2.0.51  Satisfy  directives can
    be restricted to particular methods by   < Limit >   and   < LimitExcept >   sections. 

       Merging of configuration sections 
       When any directive provided by this module is used in a new 
      configuration section, no directives provided by this module are
      inherited from previous configuration sections.
