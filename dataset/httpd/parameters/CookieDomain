CookieDomain

Description:  The domain to which the tracking cookie applies 
Syntax:   CookieDomain  domain   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_usertrack 

 This directive controls the setting of the domain to which
    the tracking cookie applies. If not present, no domain is
    included in the cookie header field. 

     The domain string  must  begin with a dot, and
     must  include at least one embedded dot. That is,
     .example.com  is legal, but  www.example.com  and
     .com  are not. 

     Most browsers in use today will not allow cookies to be set
    for a two-part top level domain, such as  .co.uk ,
    although such a domain ostensibly fulfills the requirements
    above. 

    These domains are equivalent to top level domains such as
     .com , and allowing such cookies may be a security
    risk. Thus, if you are under a two-part top level domain, you
    should still use your actual domain, as you would with any other top
    level domain (for example  .example.co.uk ).
