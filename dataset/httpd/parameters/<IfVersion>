Description:  contains version dependent configuration 
Syntax:   < IfVersion [[!] operator ]  version  > ...

Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_version 

 The  < IfVersion >  section encloses
    configuration directives which are executed only if the
      httpd   version
    matches the desired criteria. For normal (numeric) comparisons the
     version  argument has the format
      major [. minor [. patch ]] , e.g.
     2.1.0  or  2.2 .  minor  and
     patch  are optional. If these numbers are omitted, they are
    assumed to be zero. The following numerical  operator s are
    possible: 

        operator   description     =  or  ==  
         httpd version is equal      >  
         httpd version is greater than      >=  
         httpd version is greater or equal     <   
         httpd version is less than     < =  
         httpd version is less or equal     Example  < IfVersion  >= 2.3 >
    # this happens only in versions greater or
    # equal 2.3.0.
< /IfVersion > 
 

     Besides the numerical comparison it is possible to match a
     regular expression 
    against the httpd version. There are two ways to write it: 

        operator   description     =  or  ==  
          version  has the form
             / regex /      ~  
          version  has the form
              regex       Example  < IfVersion = /^2.4.[01234]$/ >
    # e.g. workaround for buggy versions
< /IfVersion > 
 

     In order to reverse the meaning, all operators can be preceded by an
    exclamation mark ( ! ): 

     < IfVersion !~ ^2.4.[01234]$ >
    # not for those versions
< /IfVersion > 


     If the  operator  is omitted, it is assumed to be
     = .
