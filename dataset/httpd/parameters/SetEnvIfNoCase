SetEnvIfNoCase

Description:  Sets environment variables based on attributes of the request
without respect to case 
Syntax:   SetEnvIfNoCase  attribute regex
        [!]env-variable [= value ]
    [[!] env-variable [= value ]] ...  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_setenvif 

 The  SetEnvIfNoCase  is semantically identical to
    the   SetEnvIf   directive,
    and differs only in that the regular expression matching is
    performed in a case-insensitive manner. For example: 
 SetEnvIfNoCase Host Example\.Org site=example 


     This will cause the  site  environment variable
    to be set to " example " if the HTTP request header
    field  Host:  was included and contained
     Example.Org ,  example.org , or any other
    combination.
