MultiviewsMatch

Description:  The types of files that will be included when searching for
a matching file with MultiViews 
Syntax:   MultiviewsMatch Any|NegotiatedOnly|Filters|Handlers
[Handlers|Filters]  
Default:   MultiviewsMatch NegotiatedOnly  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_mime 

  MultiviewsMatch  permits three different
    behaviors for  mod_negotiation 's
    Multiviews feature.  Multiviews allows a request for a file,
     e.g.   index.html , to match any negotiated
    extensions following the base request,  e.g. 
     index.html.en ,  index.html.fr , or
     index.html.gz . 

     The  NegotiatedOnly  option provides that every extension
    following the base name must correlate to a recognized
      mod_mime   extension for content negotiation,  e.g. 
    Charset, Content-Type, Language, or Encoding.  This is the strictest
    implementation with the fewest unexpected side effects, and is the
    default behavior. 

     To include extensions associated with Handlers and/or Filters,
    set the  MultiviewsMatch  directive to either
     Handlers ,  Filters , or both option keywords.
    If all other factors are equal, the smallest file will be served,
     e.g.  in deciding between  index.html.cgi  of 500
    bytes and  index.html.pl  of 1000 bytes, the  .cgi 
    file would win in this example. Users of  .asis  files
    might prefer to use the Handler option, if  .asis  files are
    associated with the  asis-handler . 

     You may finally allow  Any  extensions to match, even if
      mod_mime   doesn't recognize the extension. This can cause
    unpredictable results, such as serving .old or .bak files the webmaster
    never expected to be served. 

     For example, the following configuration will allow handlers
    and filters to participate in Multviews, but will exclude unknown
    files: 

     MultiviewsMatch Handlers Filters 


      MultiviewsMatch  is not allowed in a
      < Location >   or   < LocationMatch >   section.
