stored 
Syntax:   CacheRoot  directory   
Context:  server config, virtual host

 The  CacheRoot  directive defines the name of
    the directory on the disk to contain cache files. If the   mod_cache_disk   module has been loaded or compiled in to the
    Apache server, this directive  must  be defined. Failing to
    provide a value for  CacheRoot  will result in
    a configuration file processing error. The   CacheDirLevels   and   CacheDirLength   directives define
    the structure of the directories under the specified root directory.
