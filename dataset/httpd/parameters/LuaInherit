LuaInherit

Description:  Controls how parent configuration sections are merged into children 
Syntax:   LuaInherit none|parent-first|parent-last  
Default:   LuaInherit parent-first  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  All 
Status:  Experimental 
Module:  mod_lua 
Compatibility:  2.4.0 and later 

 By default, if LuaHook* directives are used in overlapping
    Directory or Location configuration sections, the scripts defined in the
    more specific section are run  after  those defined in the more
    generic section (LuaInherit parent-first).  You can reverse this order, or
    make the parent context not apply at all. 
    
      In previous 2.3.x releases, the default was effectively to ignore LuaHook*
    directives from parent configuration sections.
