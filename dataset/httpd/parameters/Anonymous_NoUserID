Anonymous_NoUserID

Description:  Sets whether the userID field may be empty 
Syntax:   Anonymous_NoUserID On|Off  
Default:   Anonymous_NoUserID Off  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_authn_anon 

 When set  On , users can leave the userID (and
    perhaps the password field) empty. This can be very convenient for
    MS-Explorer users who can just hit return or click directly on the
    OK button; which seems a natural reaction.
