ServerAdmin

Description:  Email address that the server includes in error
messages sent to the client 
Syntax:   ServerAdmin  email-address | URL   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 The  ServerAdmin  sets the contact address
    that the server includes in any error messages it returns to the
    client. If the  httpd  doesn't recognize the supplied argument
    as an URL, it
    assumes, that it's an  email-address  and prepends it with
     mailto:  in hyperlink targets. However, it's recommended to
    actually use an email address, since there are a lot of CGI scripts that
    make that assumption. If you want to use an URL, it should point to another
    server under your control. Otherwise users may not be able to contact you in
    case of errors. 

     It may be worth setting up a dedicated address for this, e.g. 

     ServerAdmin www-admin@foo.example.com 

     as users do not always mention that they are talking about the
    server!
