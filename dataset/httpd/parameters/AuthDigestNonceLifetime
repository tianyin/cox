AuthDigestNonceLifetime

Description:  How long the server nonce is valid 
Syntax:   AuthDigestNonceLifetime  seconds   
Default:   AuthDigestNonceLifetime 300  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_auth_digest 

 The  AuthDigestNonceLifetime  directive
    controls how long the server nonce is valid. When the client
    contacts the server using an expired nonce the server will send
    back a 401 with  stale=true . If  seconds  is
    greater than 0 then it specifies the amount of time for which the
    nonce is valid; this should probably never be set to less than 10
    seconds. If  seconds  is less than 0 then the nonce never
    expires.
