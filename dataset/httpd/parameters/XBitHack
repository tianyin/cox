XBitHack

Description:  Parse SSI directives in files with the execute bit
set 
Syntax:   XBitHack on|off|full  
Default:   XBitHack off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  Options 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_include 

 The  XBitHack  directive controls the parsing
    of ordinary html documents. This directive only affects files associated
    with the  MIME-type   text/html .  XBitHack  can take on the following values: 

       off  
       No special treatment of executable files. 

        on  
       Any  text/html  file that has the user-execute bit
      set will be treated as a server-parsed html document. 

        full  
       As for  on  but also test the group-execute bit.
      If it is set, then set the  Last-modified  date of the
      returned file to be the last modified time of the file. If
      it is not set, then no last-modified date is sent. Setting
      this bit allows clients and proxies to cache the result of
      the request.

        Note 
       You would not want to use the full option, unless you assure the
      group-execute bit is unset for every SSI script which might  #include  a CGI or otherwise produces different output on
      each hit (or could potentially change on subsequent requests). 

       The   SSILastModified  
      directive takes precedence over the
        XBitHack   directive when
        SSILastModified   is set to
       on .
