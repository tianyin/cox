<Else>

Description:  Contains directives that apply only if the condition of a
previous   < If >   or
  < ElseIf >   section is not
satisfied by a request at runtime 
Syntax:   < Else > ... < /Else >  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  All 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 The  < Else >  applies the enclosed
    directives if and only if the most recent
     < If >  or
     < ElseIf >  section
    in the same scope has not been applied.
    For example: In  

     < If "-z req('Host')" >
  # ...
< /If >
< Else >
  # ...
< /Else > 


      The  < If >  would match HTTP/1.0
        requests without a  Host:  header and the
         < Else >  would match requests
        with a  Host:  header.

    different sections are combined when a request is received.

     < ElseIf > , and
