wildcard matching available in 2.3.6 and later 

 This directive allows inclusion of other configuration files
    from within the server configuration files. 

     Shell-style ( fnmatch() ) wildcard characters can be used
    in the filename or directory parts of the path to include several files
    at once, in alphabetical order. In addition, if
     Include  points to a directory, rather than a file,
    Apache httpd will read all files in that directory and any subdirectory.
    However, including entire directories is not recommended, because it is
    easy to accidentally leave temporary files in a directory that can cause
      httpd   to fail. Instead, we encourage you to use the
    wildcard syntax shown below, to include files that match a particular
    pattern, such as *.conf, for example. 

     The   Include   directive will
     fail with an error  if a wildcard expression does not
    match any file. The   IncludeOptional  
    directive can be used if non-matching wildcards should be ignored. 

     The file path specified may be an absolute path, or may be relative
    to the   ServerRoot   directory. 

     Examples: 

     Include /usr/local/apache2/conf/ssl.conf
Include /usr/local/apache2/conf/vhosts/*.conf 


     Or, providing paths relative to your   ServerRoot   directory: 

     Include conf/ssl.conf
Include conf/vhosts/*.conf 


     Wildcards may be included in the directory or file portion of the
    path. This example will fail if there is no subdirectory in conf/vhosts
    that contains at least one *.conf file: 

     Include conf/vhosts/*/*.conf 


     Alternatively, the following command will just be ignored in case of
    missing files or directories: 

     IncludeOptional conf/vhosts/*/*.conf
