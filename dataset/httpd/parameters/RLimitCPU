RLimitCPU

Description:  Limits the CPU consumption of processes launched
by Apache httpd children 
Syntax:   RLimitCPU  seconds |max [ seconds |max]  
Default:   Unset; uses operating system defaults  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  All 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 Takes 1 or 2 parameters. The first parameter sets the soft
    resource limit for all processes and the second parameter sets
    the maximum resource limit. Either parameter can be a number,
    or  max  to indicate to the server that the limit should
    be set to the maximum allowed by the operating system
    configuration. Raising the maximum resource limit requires that
    the server is running as  root , or in the initial startup
    phase. 

     This applies to processes forked off from Apache httpd children
    servicing requests, not the Apache httpd children themselves. This
    includes CGI scripts and SSI exec commands, but not any
    processes forked off from the Apache httpd parent such as piped
    logs. 

     CPU resource limits are expressed in seconds per
    process.
