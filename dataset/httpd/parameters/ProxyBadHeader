ProxyBadHeader

Description:  Determines how to handle bad header lines in a
response 
Syntax:   ProxyBadHeader IsError|Ignore|StartBody  
Default:   ProxyBadHeader IsError  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 

 The  ProxyBadHeader  directive determines the
    behaviour of   mod_proxy   if it receives syntactically invalid
    response header lines ( i.e.  containing no colon) from the origin
    server. The following arguments are possible: 

       IsError  
     Abort the request and end up with a 502 (Bad Gateway) response. This is
    the default behaviour. 

      Ignore  
     Treat bad header lines as if they weren't sent. 

      StartBody  
     When receiving the first bad header line, finish reading the headers and
    treat the remainder as body. This helps to work around buggy backend servers
    which forget to insert an empty line between the headers and the body.
