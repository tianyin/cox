SSLSessionTicketKeyFile

Description:  Persistent encryption/decryption key for TLS session tickets 
Syntax:   SSLSessionTicketKeyFile  file-path   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 
Compatibility:  Available in httpd 2.4.0 and later, if using OpenSSL 0.9.8h or later 

 Optionally configures a secret key for encrypting and decrypting
TLS session tickets, as defined in
 RFC 5077 .
Primarily suitable for clustered environments where TLS sessions information
should be shared between multiple nodes. For single-instance httpd setups,
it is recommended to  not  configure a ticket key file, but to
rely on (random) keys generated by mod_ssl at startup, instead. 
 The ticket key file must contain 48 bytes of random data,
preferrably created from a high-entropy source. On a Unix-based system,
a ticket key file can be created as follows: 

   
dd if=/dev/random of=/path/to/file.tkey bs=1 count=48
   

 Ticket keys should be rotated (replaced) on a frequent basis,
as this is the only way to invalidate an existing session ticket -
OpenSSL currently doesn't allow to specify a limit for ticket lifetimes. 

 
 The ticket key file contains sensitive keying material and should
be protected with file permissions similar to those used for
  SSLCertificateKeyFile  .
