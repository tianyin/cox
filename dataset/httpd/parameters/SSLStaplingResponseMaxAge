 This option sets the maximum allowable age ("freshness") when
considering OCSP responses for stapling purposes, i.e. when
  SSLUseStapling   is turned on.
The default value ( -1 ) does not enforce a maximum age,
which means that OCSP responses are considered valid as long as their
 nextUpdate  field is in the future.
