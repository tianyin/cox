SessionInclude

Description:  Define URL prefixes for which a session is valid 
Syntax:   SessionInclude  path   
Default:   all URLs  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_session 

 The  SessionInclude  directive allows sessions to
    be made valid for specific URL prefixes only. This can be used to make a
    website more efficient, by targeting a more precise URL space for which
    a session should be maintained. By default, all URLs within the directory
    or location are included in the session. 

      Warning 
     This directive has a similar purpose to the  path  attribute
    in HTTP cookies, but should not be confused with this attribute. This
    directive does not set the  path  attribute, which must be
    configured separately.
