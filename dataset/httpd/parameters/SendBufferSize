SendBufferSize

Description:  TCP buffer size 
Syntax:   SendBufferSize  bytes   
Default:   SendBufferSize 0  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:    event  ,   mpm_netware  ,   mpm_winnt  ,   mpmt_os2  ,   prefork  ,   worker   

 Sets the server's TCP send buffer size to the number of bytes
    specified. It is often useful to set this past the OS's standard
    default value on high speed, high latency connections
    ( i.e. , 100ms or so, such as transcontinental fast pipes). 

     If set to the value of  0 , the server will use the
    default value provided by your OS. 

     Further configuration of your operating system may be required to elicit
    better performance on high speed, high latency connections. 

        On some operating systems, changes in TCP behavior resulting
    from a larger  SendBufferSize  may not be seen unless
      EnableSendfile   is set to OFF.  This
    interaction applies only to static files.
