ServerAlias

Description:  Alternate names for a host used when matching requests
to name-virtual hosts 
Syntax:   ServerAlias  hostname  [ hostname ] ...  
Context:  virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 The  ServerAlias  directive sets the
    alternate names for a host, for use with  name-based virtual hosts . The
     ServerAlias  may include wildcards, if appropriate. 

     < VirtualHost *:80 >
  ServerName server.example.com
  ServerAlias server server2.example.com server2
  ServerAlias *.example.com
  UseCanonicalName Off
  # ...
< /VirtualHost > 


     Name-based virtual hosts for the best-matching set of    < virtualhost >  s are processed
    in the order they appear in the configuration.  The first matching   ServerName   or   ServerAlias   is used, with no different precedence for wildcards
    (nor for ServerName vs. ServerAlias).   

     The complete list of names in the  VirtualHost 
    directive are treated just like a (non wildcard) 
     ServerAlias .
