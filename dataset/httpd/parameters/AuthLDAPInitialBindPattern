AuthLDAPInitialBindPattern

Description:  Specifies the transformation of the basic authentication username to be used when binding to the LDAP server
to perform a DN lookup 
Syntax:   AuthLDAPInitialBindPattern  regex   substitution    
Default:   AuthLDAPInitialBindPattern (.*) $1 (remote username used verbatim)  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_authnz_ldap 
Compatibility:  Available in version 2.3.6 and later 

 If   AuthLDAPInitialBindAsUser   is set to
        ON , the basic authentication username will be transformed according to the
       regular expression and substituion arguments. 

      The regular expression argument is compared against the current basic authentication username.
        The substitution argument may contain backreferences, but has no other variable interpolation. 

      This directive should only be used when your LDAP server doesn't
        accept anonymous searches and you cannot use a dedicated
          AuthLDAPBindDN  .
     

     AuthLDAPInitialBindPattern (.+) $1@example.com 

     AuthLDAPInitialBindPattern (.+) cn=$1,dc=example,dc=com 


      Not available with authorization-only 
        This directive can only be used if this module authenticates the user, and
        has no effect when this module is used exclusively for authorization.
     
      debugging 
        The substituted DN is recorded in the environment variable
         LDAP_BINDASUSER .  If the regular expression does not match the input,
        the verbatim username is used.
