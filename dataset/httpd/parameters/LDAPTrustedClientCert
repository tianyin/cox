LDAPTrustedClientCert

Description:  Sets the file containing or nickname referring to a per
connection client certificate. Not all LDAP toolkits support per
connection client certificates. 
Syntax:   LDAPTrustedClientCert  type   directory-path/filename/nickname   [password]   
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ldap 

 It specifies the directory path, file name or nickname of a
    per connection client certificate used when establishing an SSL
    or TLS connection to an LDAP server. Different locations or
    directories may have their own independent client certificate
    settings. Some LDAP toolkits (notably Novell)
    do not support per connection client certificates, and will throw an
    error on LDAP server connection if you try to use this directive
    (Use the LDAPTrustedGlobalCert directive instead for Novell client
    certificates - See the SSL/TLS certificate guide above for details).
    The type specifies the kind of certificate parameter being
    set, depending on the LDAP toolkit being used. Supported types are: 
      CA_DER - binary DER encoded CA certificate 
       CA_BASE64 - PEM encoded CA certificate 
       CERT_DER - binary DER encoded client certificate 
       CERT_BASE64 - PEM encoded client certificate 
       CERT_NICKNAME - Client certificate "nickname" (Netscape SDK) 
       KEY_DER - binary DER encoded private key 
       KEY_BASE64 - PEM encoded private key
