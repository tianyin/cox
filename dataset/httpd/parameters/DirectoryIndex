DirectoryIndex

Description:  List of resources to look for when the client requests
a directory 
Syntax:   DirectoryIndex
    disabled |  local-url  [ local-url ] ...  
Default:   DirectoryIndex index.html  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  Indexes 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_dir 

 The  DirectoryIndex  directive sets the
    list of resources to look for, when the client requests an index
    of the directory by specifying a / at the end of the directory
    name.   Local-url  is the (%-encoded) URL of a document on
    the server relative to the requested directory; it is usually the
    name of a file in the directory. Several URLs may be given, in
    which case the server will return the first one that it finds.  If
    none of the resources exist and the  Indexes  option is
    set, the server will generate its own listing of the
    directory. 

      Example  DirectoryIndex index.html 
 

     then a request for  http://example.com/docs/  would
    return  http://example.com/docs/index.html  if it
    exists, or would list the directory if it did not. 

     Note that the documents do not need to be relative to the
    directory; 

     DirectoryIndex index.html index.txt  /cgi-bin/index.pl 


     would cause the CGI script  /cgi-bin/index.pl  to be
    executed if neither  index.html  or  index.txt 
    existed in a directory. 

     A single argument of "disabled" prevents   mod_dir   from
    searching for an index.  An argument of "disabled" will be interpreted
    literally if it has any arguments before or after it, even if they are "disabled"
    as well. 

      Note:  Multiple  DirectoryIndex 
    directives within the   same context   will add
    to the list of resources to look for rather than replace:
     
     # Example A: Set index.html as an index page, then add index.php to that list as well.
< Directory /foo >
    DirectoryIndex index.html
    DirectoryIndex index.php
< /Directory >

# Example B: This is identical to example A, except it's done with a single directive.
< Directory /foo >
    DirectoryIndex index.html index.php
< /Directory >

# Example C: To replace the list, you must explicitly reset it first:
# In this example, only index.php will remain as an index resource.
< Directory /foo >
    DirectoryIndex index.html
    DirectoryIndex disabled
    DirectoryIndex index.php
< /Directory >
