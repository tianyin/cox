ExpiresByType

Description:  Value of the  Expires  header configured
by MIME type 
Syntax:   ExpiresByType  MIME-type 
 < code >seconds   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  Indexes 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_expires 

 This directive defines the value of the  Expires 
    header and the  max-age  directive of the
     Cache-Control  header generated for documents of the
    specified type ( e.g. ,  text/html ). The second
    argument sets the number of seconds that will be added to a base
    time to construct the expiration date.  The  Cache-Control:
    max-age  is calculated by subtracting the request time from
    the expiration date and expressing the result in seconds. 

     The base time is either the last modification time of the
    file, or the time of the client's access to the document. Which
    should be used is specified by the
      < code >   field;  M 
    means that the file's last modification time should be used as
    the base time, and  A  means the client's access
    time should be used. 

     The difference in effect is subtle. If  M  is used,
    all current copies of the document in all caches will expire at
    the same time, which can be good for something like a weekly
    notice that's always found at the same URL. If  A  is
    used, the date of expiration is different for each client; this
    can be good for image files that don't change very often,
    particularly for a set of related documents that all refer to
    the same images ( i.e. , the images will be accessed
    repeatedly within a relatively short timespan). 

      Example:  # enable expirations
ExpiresActive On
# expire GIF images after a month in the client's cache
ExpiresByType image/gif A2592000
# HTML documents are good for a week from the
# time they were changed
ExpiresByType text/html M604800 
 

     Note that this directive only has effect if
     ExpiresActive On  has been specified. It overrides,
    for the specified MIME type  only , any expiration date
    set by the   ExpiresDefault  
    directive. 

     You can also specify the expiration time calculation using
    an  alternate syntax , described earlier in
    this document.
