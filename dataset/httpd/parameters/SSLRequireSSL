SSLRequireSSL

Description:  Deny access when SSL is not used for the
HTTP request 
Syntax:   SSLRequireSSL  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

 
This directive forbids access unless HTTP over SSL (i.e. HTTPS) is enabled for
the current connection. This is very handy inside the SSL-enabled virtual
host or directories for defending against configuration errors that expose
stuff that should be protected. When this directive is present all requests
are denied which are not using SSL.
