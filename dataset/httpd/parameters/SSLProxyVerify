SSLProxyVerify

Description:  Type of remote server Certificate verification 
Syntax:   SSLProxyVerify  level   
Default:   SSLProxyVerify none  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

 When a proxy is configured to forward requests to a remote SSL
server, this directive can be used to configure certificate
verification of the remote server.  
 
The following levels are available for  level : 
   none :
     no remote server Certificate is required at all 
  optional :
     the remote server  may  present a valid Certificate 
  require :
     the remote server  has to  present a valid Certificate 
  optional_no_ca :
     the remote server may present a valid Certificate 
     but it need not to be (successfully) verifiable. 
  In practice only levels  none  and
 require  are really interesting, because level
 optional  doesn't work with all servers and level
 optional_no_ca  is actually against the idea of
authentication (but can be used to establish SSL test pages, etc.) 
  Example  SSLProxyVerify require
