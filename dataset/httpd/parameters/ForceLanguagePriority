ForceLanguagePriority

Description:  Action to take if a single acceptable document is not
found 
Syntax:   ForceLanguagePriority None|Prefer|Fallback [Prefer|Fallback]  
Default:   ForceLanguagePriority Prefer  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_negotiation 

 The  ForceLanguagePriority  directive uses
    the given   LanguagePriority   to satisfy
    negotiation where the server could otherwise not return a single
    matching document. 

      ForceLanguagePriority Prefer  uses
     LanguagePriority  to serve a one valid result, rather
    than returning an HTTP result 300 (MULTIPLE CHOICES) when there
    are several equally valid choices.  If the directives below were
    given, and the user's  Accept-Language  header assigned
     en  and  de  each as quality  .500 
    (equally acceptable) then the first matching variant,  en ,
    will be served.

      ForceLanguagePriority Fallback  uses
      LanguagePriority   to
    serve a valid result, rather than returning an HTTP result 406
    (NOT ACCEPTABLE). If the directives below were given, and the user's
     Accept-Language  only permitted an  es 
    language response, but such a variant isn't found, then the first
    variant from the   LanguagePriority   list below will be served.

     Both options,  Prefer  and  Fallback , may be
    specified, so either the first matching variant from   LanguagePriority   will be served if
    more than one variant is acceptable, or first available document will
    be served if none of the variants matched the client's acceptable list
    of languages.
