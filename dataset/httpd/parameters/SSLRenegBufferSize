SSLRenegBufferSize

Description:  Set the size for the SSL renegotiation buffer 
Syntax:   SSLRenegBufferSize  bytes   
Default:   SSLRenegBufferSize 131072  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

 If an SSL renegotiation is required in per-location context, for
example, any use of   SSLVerifyClient   in a Directory or
Location block, then   mod_ssl   must buffer any HTTP
request body into memory until the new SSL handshake can be performed.
This directive can be used to set the amount of memory that will be
used for this buffer.  

  
Note that in many configurations, the client sending the request body
will be untrusted so a denial of service attack by consumption of
memory must be considered when changing this configuration setting.
  

  Example  SSLRenegBufferSize 262144
