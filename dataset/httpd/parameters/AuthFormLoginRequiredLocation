AuthFormLoginRequiredLocation

Description:  The URL of the page to be redirected to should login be required 
Syntax:   AuthFormLoginRequiredLocation  url   
Default:   none  
Context:  directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_auth_form 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.3.0 and later. The use of the expression
parser hass been added in 2.4.4. 

 The   AuthFormLoginRequiredLocation   directive
    specifies the URL to redirect to should the user not be authorised to view a page. The value
    is parsed using the  ap_expr  parser before being sent to the client.
    By default, if a user is not authorised to view a page, the HTTP response code
     HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED  will be returned with the page specified by the
      ErrorDocument   directive. This directive overrides this
    default. 

     Use this directive if you have a dedicated login page to redirect users to.
