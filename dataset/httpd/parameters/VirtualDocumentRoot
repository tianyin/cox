VirtualDocumentRoot

Description:  Dynamically configure the location of the document root
for a given virtual host 
Syntax:   VirtualDocumentRoot  interpolated-directory |none  
Default:   VirtualDocumentRoot none  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_vhost_alias 

 The  VirtualDocumentRoot  directive allows you to
    determine where Apache HTTP Server will find your documents based on the
    value of the server name. The result of expanding
     interpolated-directory  is used as the root of the
    document tree in a similar manner to the   DocumentRoot   directive's argument.
    If  interpolated-directory  is  none  then
     VirtualDocumentRoot  is turned off. This directive
    cannot be used in the same context as   VirtualDocumentRootIP  . 

  Note 
 VirtualDocumentRoot  will override any   DocumentRoot   directives you may have put in the same 
context or child contexts. Putting a  VirtualDocumentRoot  
in the global server scope will effectively override   DocumentRoot   directives in any virtual hosts defined later 
on, unless you set  VirtualDocumentRoot  to  None  
in each virtual host.
