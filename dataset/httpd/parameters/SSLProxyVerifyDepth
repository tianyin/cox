SSLProxyVerifyDepth

Description:  Maximum depth of CA Certificates in Remote Server
Certificate verification 
Syntax:   SSLProxyVerifyDepth  number   
Default:   SSLProxyVerifyDepth 1  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

 
This directive sets how deeply mod_ssl should verify before deciding that the
remote server does not have a valid certificate.  
 
The depth actually is the maximum number of intermediate certificate issuers,
i.e. the number of CA certificates which are max allowed to be followed while
verifying the remote server certificate. A depth of 0 means that self-signed
remote server certificates are accepted only, the default depth of 1 means
the remote server certificate can be self-signed or has to be signed by a CA
which is directly known to the server (i.e. the CA's certificate is under
  SSLProxyCACertificatePath  ), etc. 
  Example  SSLProxyVerifyDepth 10
