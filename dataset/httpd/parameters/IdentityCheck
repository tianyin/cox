IdentityCheck

Description:  Enables logging of the RFC 1413 identity of the remote
user 
Syntax:   IdentityCheck On|Off  
Default:   IdentityCheck Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ident 
Compatibility:  Moved out of core in Apache 2.1 

 This directive enables  RFC 1413 -compliant logging of the remote user name for each
    connection, where the client machine runs identd or something similar.
    This information is logged in the access log using the  %...l 
     format string . 

     
      The information should not be trusted in any way except for
      rudimentary usage tracking.
     

     Note that this can cause serious latency problems accessing
    your server since every request requires one of these lookups
    to be performed. When firewalls or proxy servers are involved,
    each lookup might possibly fail and add a latency duration as
    defined by the   IdentityCheckTimeout   directive to each hit. So in
    general this is not very useful on public servers accessible from
    the Internet.
