EnableSendfile

Description:  Use the kernel sendfile support to deliver files to the client 
Syntax:   EnableSendfile On|Off  
Default:   EnableSendfile Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 
Compatibility:  Default changed to Off in
version 2.3.9. 

 This directive controls whether   httpd   may use the
    sendfile support from the kernel to transmit file contents to the client.
    By default, when the handling of a request requires no access
    to the data within a file -- for example, when delivering a
    static file -- Apache httpd uses sendfile to deliver the file contents
    without ever reading the file if the OS supports it. 

     This sendfile mechanism avoids separate read and send operations,
    and buffer allocations. But on some platforms or within some
    filesystems, it is better to disable this feature to avoid
    operational problems: 

      Some platforms may have broken sendfile support that the build
    system did not detect, especially if the binaries were built on
    another box and moved to such a machine with broken sendfile
    support. 
     On Linux the use of sendfile triggers TCP-checksum
    offloading bugs on certain networking cards when using IPv6. 
     On Linux on Itanium,  sendfile  may be unable to handle
    files over 2GB in size. 
     With a network-mounted   DocumentRoot   (e.g., NFS, SMB, CIFS, FUSE),
    the kernel may be unable to serve the network file through
    its own cache. 
      For server configurations that are not vulnerable to these problems,
    you may enable this feature by specifying: 

     EnableSendfile On 


     For network mounted files, this feature may be disabled explicitly
    for the offending files by specifying: 

     < Directory "/path-to-nfs-files" >
  EnableSendfile Off
< /Directory > 

     Please note that the per-directory and .htaccess configuration
       of  EnableSendfile  is not supported by
         mod_cache_disk  .
       Only global definition of  EnableSendfile 
       is taken into account by the module.
