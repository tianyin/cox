AddType

Description:  Maps the given filename extensions onto the specified content
type 
Syntax:   AddType  media-type   extension 
[ extension ] ...  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_mime 

 The  AddType  directive maps the given
    filename extensions onto the specified content
    type.  media-type  is the  media
    type  to use for filenames containing
     extension . This mapping is added to any already in
    force, overriding any mappings that already exist for the same
     extension . 

     
      It is recommended that new media types be added using the
       AddType  directive rather than changing the
        TypesConfig   file.
     

      Example  AddType image/gif .gif 
 

     Or, to specify multiple file extensions in one directive: 

      Example  AddType image/jpeg jpeg jpg jpe 
 

     The  extension  argument is case-insensitive and can
    be specified with or without a leading dot. Filenames may have  multiple extensions  and the
     extension  argument will be compared against each of
    them. 

     A simmilar effect to   mod_negotiation  's
      LanguagePriority  
    can be achieved by qualifying a  media-type  with
     qs : 

      Example  AddType application/rss+xml;qs=0.8 .xml 
 

     This is useful in situations,  e.g.  when a client
    requesting  Accept: */*  can not actually processes
    the content returned by the server. 

     This directive primarily configures the content types generated for
    static files served out of the filesystem.  For resources other than
    static files, where the generator of the response typically specifies
    a Content-Type, this directive has no effect.
