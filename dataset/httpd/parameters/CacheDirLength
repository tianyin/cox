CacheDirLength

Description:  The number of characters in subdirectory names 
Syntax:   CacheDirLength  length   
Default:   CacheDirLength 2  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache_disk 

 The  CacheDirLength  directive sets the number
    of characters for each subdirectory name in the cache hierarchy. It can
    be used in conjunction with  CacheDirLevels  to
    determine the approximate structure of your cache hierarchy. 
     A high value for  CacheDirLength  combined
    with a low value for  CacheDirLevels  will result in
    a relatively flat hierarchy, with a large number of subdirectories at each
    level. 

     
       The result of   CacheDirLevels  *  CacheDirLength 
      must not be higher than 20.
