FileETag

Description:  File attributes used to create the ETag
HTTP response header for static files 
Syntax:   FileETag  component  ...  
Default:   FileETag MTime Size  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 
Compatibility:  The default used to be "INode&#160;MTime&#160;Size" in 2.3.14 and
earlier. 

 
    The  FileETag  directive configures the file
    attributes that are used to create the  ETag  (entity
    tag) response header field when the document is based on a static file.
    (The  ETag  value is used in cache management to save
    network bandwidth.) The
     FileETag  directive allows you to choose
    which of these -- if any -- should be used. The recognized keywords are:
     

       INode  
      The file's i-node number will be included in the calculation 
       MTime  
      The date and time the file was last modified will be included 
       Size  
      The number of bytes in the file will be included 
       All  
      All available fields will be used. This is equivalent to:
          FileETag INode MTime Size 
 
       None  
      If a document is file-based, no  ETag  field will be
       included in the response 
      The  INode ,  MTime , and  Size 
    keywords may be prefixed with either  +  or  - ,
    which allow changes to be made to the default setting inherited
    from a broader scope. Any keyword appearing without such a prefix
    immediately and completely cancels the inherited setting. 

     If a directory's configuration includes
     FileETag&#160;INode&#160;MTime&#160;Size , and a
    subdirectory's includes  FileETag&#160;-INode ,
    the setting for that subdirectory (which will be inherited by
    any sub-subdirectories that don't override it) will be equivalent to
     FileETag&#160;MTime&#160;Size . 
      Warning 
    Do not change the default for directories or locations that have WebDAV
    enabled and use   mod_dav_fs   as a storage provider.
      mod_dav_fs   uses  MTime&#160;Size 
    as a fixed format for  ETag  comparisons on conditional requests.
    These conditional requests will break if the  ETag  format is
    changed via  FileETag .
     
      Server Side Includes 
    An ETag is not generated for responses parsed by   mod_include  ,
    since the response entity can change without a change of the INode, MTime, or Size
    of the static file with embedded SSI directives.
