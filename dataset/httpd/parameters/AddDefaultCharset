AddDefaultCharset

Description:  Default charset parameter to be added when a response
content-type is  text/plain  or  text/html  
Syntax:   AddDefaultCharset On|Off| charset   
Default:   AddDefaultCharset Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 This directive specifies a default value for the media type
    charset parameter (the name of a character encoding) to be added
    to a response if and only if the response's content-type is either
     text/plain  or  text/html .  This should override
    any charset specified in the body of the response via a  META 
    element, though the exact behavior is often dependent on the user's client
    configuration. A setting of  AddDefaultCharset Off 
    disables this functionality.  AddDefaultCharset On  enables
    a default charset of  iso-8859-1 . Any other value is assumed
    to be the  charset  to be used, which should be one of the
     IANA registered
    charset values  for use in Internet media types (MIME types).
    For example: 

     AddDefaultCharset utf-8 


      AddDefaultCharset  should only be used when all
    of the text resources to which it applies are known to be in that
    character encoding and it is too inconvenient to label their charset
    individually. One such example is to add the charset parameter
    to resources containing generated content, such as legacy CGI
    scripts, that might be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks
    due to user-provided data being included in the output.  Note, however,
    that a better solution is to just fix (or delete) those scripts, since
    setting a default charset does not protect users that have enabled
    the "auto-detect character encoding" feature on their browser.
