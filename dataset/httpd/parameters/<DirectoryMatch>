<DirectoryMatch>

Description:  Enclose directives that apply to
the contents of file-system directories matching a regular expression. 
Syntax:   < DirectoryMatch  regex  >
... < /DirectoryMatch >  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

  < DirectoryMatch >  and
     < /DirectoryMatch >  are used to enclose a group
    of directives which will apply only to the named directory (and the files within),
    the same as   < Directory >  .
    However, it takes as an argument a
     regular expression .  For example: 

     < DirectoryMatch "^/www/(.+/)?[0-9]{3}" >
    # ...
< /DirectoryMatch > 


     would match directories in  /www/  that consisted of three
    numbers. 

     Compatability 
      Prior to 2.3.9, this directive implicitly applied to sub-directories
      (like   < Directory >  ) and
      could not match the end of line symbol ($).  In 2.3.9 and later,
      only directories that match the expression are affected by the enclosed
      directives.
     

      Trailing Slash 
      This directive applies to requests for directories that may or may
      not end in a trailing slash, so expressions that are anchored to the
      end of line ($) must be written with care.
     

     From 2.4.8 onwards, named groups and backreferences are captured and
    written to the environment with the corresponding name prefixed with
    "MATCH_" and in upper case. This allows elements of paths to be referenced
    from within  expressions  and modules like
      mod_rewrite  . In order to prevent confusion, numbered
    (unnamed) backreferences are ignored. Use named groups instead. 

 < DirectoryMatch ^/var/www/combined/(?< sitename >[^/]+) >
    require ldap-group cn=%{env:MATCH_SITENAME},ou=combined,o=Example
< /DirectoryMatch >
