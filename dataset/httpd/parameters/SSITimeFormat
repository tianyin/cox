 This directive changes the format in which date strings are displayed
    when echoing  DATE  environment variables. The
     formatstring  is as in  strftime(3)  from the
    C standard library. 

     This directive has the same effect as the  < !--#config
    timefmt= formatstring  -- >  element. 

     SSITimeFormat "%R, %B %d, %Y" 


     The above directive would cause times to be displayed in the
    format "22:26, June 14, 2002".
