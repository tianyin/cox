Description:  The number of levels of subdirectories in the
cache. 
Syntax:   CacheDirLevels  levels   
Default:   CacheDirLevels 2  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache_disk 

 The  CacheDirLevels  directive sets the number
    of subdirectory levels in the cache. Cached data will be saved this
    many directory levels below the   CacheRoot   directory. 
     A high value for  CacheDirLevels  combined
    with a low value for  CacheDirLength  will result in
    a relatively deep hierarchy, with a small number of subdirectories at each
    level. 

     
       The result of  CacheDirLevels *
        CacheDirLength   must
      not be higher than 20.
