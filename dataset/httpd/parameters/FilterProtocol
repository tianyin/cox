FilterProtocol

Description:  Deal with correct HTTP protocol handling 
Syntax:   FilterProtocol  filter-name  [ provider-name ]
     proto-flags   
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  Options 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_filter 

 This directs   mod_filter   to deal with ensuring the
    filter doesn't run when it shouldn't, and that the HTTP response
    headers are correctly set taking into account the effects of the
    filter. 

     There are two forms of this directive.  With three arguments, it
    applies specifically to a  filter-name  and a
     provider-name  for that filter.
    With two arguments it applies to a  filter-name  whenever the
    filter runs  any  provider. 

     Flags specified with this directive are merged with the flags 
    that underlying providers may have registerd with 
      mod_filter  . For example, a filter may internally specify
    the equivalent of  change=yes , but a particular 
    configuration of the module can override with  change=no .
     

      proto-flags  is one or more of 

       change=yes|no  
     Specifies whether the filter changes the content, including possibly 
    the content length.  The "no" argument is supported in 2.4.7 and later. 

      change=1:1  
     The filter changes the content, but will not change the content
    length 

      byteranges=no  
     The filter cannot work on byteranges and requires complete input 

      proxy=no  
     The filter should not run in a proxy context 

      proxy=transform  
     The filter transforms the response in a manner incompatible with
    the HTTP  Cache-Control: no-transform  header. 

      cache=no  
     The filter renders the output uncacheable (eg by introducing randomised
    content changes)
