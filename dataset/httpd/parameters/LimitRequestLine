LimitRequestLine

Description:  Limit the size of the HTTP request line that will be accepted
from the client 
Syntax:   LimitRequestLine  bytes   
Default:   LimitRequestLine 8190  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 This directive sets the number of  bytes  that will be
    allowed on the HTTP request-line. 

     The  LimitRequestLine  directive allows
    the server administrator to set the limit on the allowed size
    of a client's HTTP request-line. Since the request-line consists of the
    HTTP method, URI, and protocol version, the
     LimitRequestLine  directive places a
    restriction on the length of a request-URI allowed for a request
    on the server. A server needs this value to be large enough to
    hold any of its resource names, including any information that
    might be passed in the query part of a  GET  request. 

     This directive gives the server administrator greater
    control over abnormal client request behavior, which may be
    useful for avoiding some forms of denial-of-service attacks. 

     For example: 

     LimitRequestLine 4094 


     Under normal conditions, the value should not be changed from
    the default. Also, you can't set this higher than 8190 without
    modifying the source and rebuilding. 

      Warning 
      When name-based virtual hosting is used, the value for this
    directive is taken from the default (first-listed) virtual host best
    matching the current IP address and port combination.
