BalancerInherit

Description:  Inherit ProxyPassed Balancers/Workers from the main server 
Syntax:   BalancerInherit On|Off  
Default:   BalancerInherit On  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 
Compatibility:  BalancerInherit is only available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.5 and later. 

 This directive will cause the current server/vhost to "inherit" ProxyPass
            Balancers and Workers defined in the main server. This can cause issues and
            inconsistent behavior if using the Balancer Manager and so should be disabled
            if using that feature. 
         The setting in the global server defines the default for all vhosts.
