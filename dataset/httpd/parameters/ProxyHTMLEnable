ProxyHTMLEnable

Description:  Turns the proxy_html filter on or off. 
Syntax:   ProxyHTMLEnable  On|Off   
Default:   ProxyHTMLEnable Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_proxy_html 
Compatibility:  Version 2.4 and later; available as a third-party
module for earlier 2.x versions. 

 A simple switch to enable or disable the proxy_html filter.
    If   mod_xml2enc   is loaded it will also automatically
    set up internationalisation support. 
     Note that the proxy_html filter will only act on HTML data
    (Content-Type text/html or application/xhtml+xml) and when the
    data are proxied.  You can override this (at your own risk) by
    setting the  PROXY_HTML_FORCE  environment variable.
