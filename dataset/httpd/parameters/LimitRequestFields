LimitRequestFields

Description:  Limits the number of HTTP request header fields that
will be accepted from the client 
Syntax:   LimitRequestFields  number   
Default:   LimitRequestFields 100  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

  Number  is an integer from 0 (meaning unlimited) to
    32767. The default value is defined by the compile-time
    constant  DEFAULT_LIMIT_REQUEST_FIELDS  (100 as
    distributed). 

     The  LimitRequestFields  directive allows
    the server administrator to modify the limit on the number of
    request header fields allowed in an HTTP request. A server needs
    this value to be larger than the number of fields that a normal
    client request might include. The number of request header fields
    used by a client rarely exceeds 20, but this may vary among
    different client implementations, often depending upon the extent
    to which a user has configured their browser to support detailed
    content negotiation. Optional HTTP extensions are often expressed
    using request header fields. 

     This directive gives the server administrator greater
    control over abnormal client request behavior, which may be
    useful for avoiding some forms of denial-of-service attacks.
    The value should be increased if normal clients see an error
    response from the server that indicates too many fields were
    sent in the request. 

     For example: 

     LimitRequestFields 50 


       Warning 
       When name-based virtual hosting is used, the value for this
     directive is taken from the default (first-listed) virtual host for the
     local IP and port combination.
