AuthBasicUseDigestAlgorithm

Description:  Check passwords against the authentication providers as if
Digest Authentication was in force instead of Basic Authentication.
 
Syntax:   AuthBasicUseDigestAlgorithm MD5|Off  
Default:   AuthBasicUseDigestAlgorithm Off  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_auth_basic 
Compatibility:  Apache HTTP Server 2.4.7 and later 

 Normally, when using Basic Authentication, the providers listed in
      AuthBasicProvider  
    attempt to verify a user by checking their data stores for
    a matching username and associated password.  The stored passwords
    are usually encrypted, but not necessarily so; each provider may
    choose its own storage scheme for passwords. 

     When using   AuthDigestProvider   and Digest
    Authentication, providers perform a similar check to find a matching
    username in their data stores.  However, unlike in the Basic
    Authentication case, the value associated with each stored username
    must be an encrypted string composed from the username, realm name,
    and password.  (See
     
    RFC 2617, Section 3.2.2.2  for more details on the format used
    for this encrypted string.) 

     As a consequence of the difference in the stored values between
    Basic and Digest Authentication, converting from Digest
    Authentication to Basic Authentication generally requires that all
    users be assigned new passwords, as their existing passwords cannot
    be recovered from the password storage scheme imposed on those
    providers which support Digest Authentication. 

     Setting the   AuthBasicUseDigestAlgorithm   directive
    to  MD5  will cause the user's Basic Authentication password
    to be checked using the same encrypted format as for Digest
    Authentication.  First a string composed from the username, realm name,
    and password is hashed with MD5; then the username and this encrypted
    string are passed to the providers listed in
      AuthBasicProvider  
    as if
      AuthType  
    was set to  Digest  and Digest Authentication was in force.
     

     Through the use of   AuthBasicUseDigestAlgorithm  
    a site may switch from Digest to Basic Authentication without
    requiring users to be assigned new passwords. 

     
      The inverse process of switching from Basic to Digest
      Authentication without assigning new passwords is generally
      not possible.  Only if the Basic Authentication passwords
      have been stored in plain text or with a reversable encryption
      scheme will it be possible to recover them and generate a
      new data store following the Digest Authentication password
      storage scheme.
     

     
      Only providers which support Digest Authentication will be able
      to authenticate users when   AuthBasicUseDigestAlgorithm  
      is set to  MD5 .  Use of other providers will result
      in an error response and the client will be denied access.
