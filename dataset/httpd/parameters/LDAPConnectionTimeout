LDAPConnectionTimeout

Description:  Specifies the socket connection timeout in seconds 
Syntax:   LDAPConnectionTimeout  seconds   
Context:  server config 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ldap 

 This directive configures the LDAP_OPT_NETWORK_TIMEOUT (or LDAP_OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT)
    option in the underlying LDAP client library, when available.  This value
    typically controls how long the LDAP client library will wait for the TCP
    connection to the LDAP server to complete. 

      If a connection is not successful with the timeout period, either an error will be
    returned or the LDAP client library will attempt to connect to a secondary LDAP
    server if one is specified (via a space-separated list of hostnames in the
      AuthLDAPURL  ). 

     The default is 10 seconds, if the LDAP client library linked with the
    server supports the LDAP_OPT_NETWORK_TIMEOUT option. 

     LDAPConnectionTimeout is only available when the LDAP client library linked
    with the server supports the LDAP_OPT_NETWORK_TIMEOUT
    (or LDAP_OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT) option, and the ultimate behavior is
    dictated entirely by the LDAP client library.
