AuthLDAPBindAuthoritative

Description:  Determines if other authentication providers are used when a user can be mapped to a DN but the server cannot successfully bind with the user's credentials. 
Syntax:   AuthLDAPBindAuthoritative off|on   
Default:   AuthLDAPBindAuthoritative on  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_authnz_ldap 

 By default, subsequent authentication providers are only queried if a
    user cannot be mapped to a DN, but not if the user can be mapped to a DN and their
    password cannot be verified with an LDAP bind.
    If   AuthLDAPBindAuthoritative  
    is set to  off , other configured authentication modules will have
    a chance to validate the user if the LDAP bind (with the current user's credentials)
    fails for any reason. 
      This allows users present in both LDAP and
      AuthUserFile   to authenticate
    when the LDAP server is available but the user's account is locked or password
    is otherwise unusable.
