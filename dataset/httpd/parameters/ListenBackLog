ListenBackLog

Description:  Maximum length of the queue of pending connections 
Syntax:   ListenBacklog  backlog   
Default:   ListenBacklog 511  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:    event  ,   mpm_netware  ,   mpm_winnt  ,   mpmt_os2  ,   prefork  ,   worker   

 The maximum length of the queue of pending connections.
    Generally no tuning is needed or desired, however on some
    systems it is desirable to increase this when under a TCP SYN
    flood attack. See the backlog parameter to the
     listen(2)  system call. 

     This will often be limited to a smaller number by the
    operating system. This varies from OS to OS. Also note that
    many OSes do not use exactly what is specified as the backlog,
    but use a number based on (but normally larger than) what is
    set.
