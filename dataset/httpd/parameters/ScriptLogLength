ScriptLogLength

Description:  Size limit of the CGI script logfile 
Syntax:   ScriptLogLength  bytes   
Default:   ScriptLogLength 10385760  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Base 
Module:    mod_cgi  ,   mod_cgid   

  ScriptLogLength  can be used to limit the
    size of the CGI script logfile. Since the logfile logs a lot of
    information per CGI error (all request headers, all script output)
    it can grow to be a big file. To prevent problems due to unbounded
    growth, this directive can be used to set an maximum file-size for
    the CGI logfile. If the file exceeds this size, no more
    information will be written to it.
