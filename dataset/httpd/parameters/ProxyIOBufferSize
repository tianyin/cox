ProxyIOBufferSize

Description:  Determine size of internal data throughput buffer 
Syntax:   ProxyIOBufferSize  bytes   
Default:   ProxyIOBufferSize 8192  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 

 The  ProxyIOBufferSize  directive adjusts the size
    of the internal buffer, which is used as a scratchpad for the data between
    input and output. The size must be at least  512 . 

     In almost every case there's no reason to change that value. 

     If used with AJP this directive sets the maximum AJP packet size in
    bytes. Values larger than 65536 are set to 65536. If you change it from
    the default, you must also change the  packetSize  attribute of
    your AJP connector on the Tomcat side! The attribute
     packetSize  is only available in Tomcat  5.5.20+ 
    and  6.0.2+  

     Normally it is not necessary to change the maximum packet size.
    Problems with the default value have been reported when sending
    certificates or certificate chains.
