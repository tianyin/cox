This directive can be used to control which versions of the SSL/TLS protocol
will be accepted in new connections. 
 
The available (case-insensitive)  protocol s are: 
   SSLv3 
     
    This is the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, version 3.0, from
    the Netscape Corporation.
    It is the successor to SSLv2 and the predecessor to TLSv1.  

  TLSv1 
     
    This is the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, version 1.0.
    It is the successor to SSLv3 and is defined in
     RFC 2246 .
    It is supported by nearly every client.  

  TLSv1.1  (when using OpenSSL 1.0.1 and later)
     
    A revision of the TLS 1.0 protocol, as defined in
     RFC 4346 .  

  TLSv1.2  (when using OpenSSL 1.0.1 and later)
     
    A revision of the TLS 1.1 protocol, as defined in
     RFC 5246 .  

  all 
     
    This is a shortcut for `` +SSLv3 +TLSv1 '' or
    - when using OpenSSL 1.0.1 and later -
    `` +SSLv3 +TLSv1 +TLSv1.1 +TLSv1.2 , respectively.
