 Cacheing authentication data can be a security issue, though short-term
    cacheing is unlikely to be a problem.  Typically a good solution is to
    cache credentials for as long as it takes to relieve the load on a
    backend, but no longer, though if changes to your users and passwords
    are infrequent then a longer timeout may suit you.  The default 300
    seconds (5 minutes) is both cautious and ample to keep the load
    on a backend such as dbd (SQL database queries) down. 
     This should not be confused with session timeout, which is an
    entirely separate issue.  However, you may wish to check your
    session-management software for whether cached credentials can
    "accidentally" extend a session, and bear it in mind when setting
    your timeout.
