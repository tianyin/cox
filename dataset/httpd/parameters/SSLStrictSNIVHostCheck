This directive sets whether a non-SNI client is allowed to access a name-based
virtual host. If set to  on  in the default name-based virtual
host, clients that are SNI unaware will not be allowed to access  any 
virtual host, belonging to this particular IP / port combination.
If set to  on  in any other virtual host, SNI unaware clients
are not allowed to access this particular virtual host.
 

  
This option is only available if httpd was compiled against an SNI capable
version of OpenSSL.
