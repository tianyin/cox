ScoreBoardFile

Description:  Location of the file used to store coordination data for
the child processes 
Syntax:   ScoreBoardFile  file-path   
Default:   ScoreBoardFile logs/apache_runtime_status  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:    event  ,   mpm_winnt  ,   prefork  ,   worker   

 Apache HTTP Server uses a scoreboard to communicate between its parent
    and child processes.  Some architectures require a file to facilitate
    this communication. If the file is left unspecified, Apache httpd first
    attempts to create the scoreboard entirely in memory (using anonymous
    shared memory) and, failing that, will attempt to create the file on
    disk (using file-based shared memory). Specifying this directive causes
    Apache httpd to always create the file on the disk. 

      Example  ScoreBoardFile /var/run/apache_runtime_status 
 

     File-based shared memory is useful for third-party applications
    that require direct access to the scoreboard. 

     If you use a  ScoreBoardFile  then
    you may see improved speed by placing it on a RAM disk. But be
    careful that you heed the same warnings about log file placement
    and  security .
