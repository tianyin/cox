AddCharset

Description:  Maps the given filename extensions to the specified content
charset 
Syntax:   AddCharset  charset   extension 
[ extension ] ...  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_mime 

 The  AddCharset  directive maps the given
    filename extensions to the specified content charset (the Internet
    registered name for a given character encoding).  charset 
    is the  media
    type's charset parameter  for resources with filenames containing
     extension . This mapping is added to any already in force,
    overriding any mappings that already exist for the same
     extension . 

      Example  AddLanguage ja .ja
AddCharset EUC-JP .euc
AddCharset ISO-2022-JP .jis
AddCharset SHIFT_JIS .sjis 
 

     Then the document  xxxx.ja.jis  will be treated
    as being a Japanese document whose charset is  ISO-2022-JP 
    (as will the document  xxxx.jis.ja ). The
     AddCharset  directive is useful for both to
    inform the client about the character encoding of the document so that
    the document can be interpreted and displayed appropriately, and for  content negotiation ,
    where the server returns one from several documents based on
    the client's charset preference. 

     The  extension  argument is case-insensitive and can
    be specified with or without a leading dot. Filenames may have  multiple extensions  and the
     extension  argument will be compared against each of
    them.
