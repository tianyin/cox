Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy

 This directive will cause the shared memory storage associated
        with the balancers and balancer members to be persisted across
        restarts. This allows these local changes to not be lost during the
        normal restart/graceful state transitions.
