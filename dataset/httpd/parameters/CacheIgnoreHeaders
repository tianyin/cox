CacheIgnoreHeaders

Description:  Do not store the given HTTP header(s) in the cache.
 
Syntax:   CacheIgnoreHeaders  header-string  [ header-string ] ...  
Default:   CacheIgnoreHeaders None  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache 

 According to RFC 2616, hop-by-hop HTTP headers are not stored in
    the cache.  The following HTTP headers are hop-by-hop headers and thus
    do not get stored in the cache in  any  case regardless of the
    setting of  CacheIgnoreHeaders : 

       Connection  
        Keep-Alive  
        Proxy-Authenticate  
        Proxy-Authorization  
        TE  
        Trailers  
        Transfer-Encoding  
        Upgrade  
       CacheIgnoreHeaders  specifies additional HTTP
    headers that should not to be stored in the cache.  For example, it makes
    sense in some cases to prevent cookies from being stored in the cache. 

      CacheIgnoreHeaders  takes a space separated list
    of HTTP headers that should not be stored in the cache. If only hop-by-hop
    headers not should be stored in the cache (the RFC 2616 compliant
    behaviour),  CacheIgnoreHeaders  can be set to
     None . 

      Example 1  CacheIgnoreHeaders Set-Cookie 
 

      Example 2  CacheIgnoreHeaders None 
 

      Warning: 
      If headers like  Expires  which are needed for proper cache
      management are not stored due to a
       CacheIgnoreHeaders  setting, the behaviour of
      mod_cache is undefined.
