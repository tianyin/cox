LogMessage

Description:  Log user-defined message to error log
 
Syntax:   LogMessage  message 
[hook= hook ] [expr= expression ]
  
Default:   Unset  
Context:  directory 
Status:  Experimental 
Module:  mod_log_debug 

 This directive causes a user defined message to be logged to the
    error log. The message can use variables and functions from the
     ap_expr syntax . References to HTTP headers
    will not cause header names to be added to the Vary header. The
    messages are logged at loglevel info. 

     The hook specifies before which phase of request processing the message
    will be logged. The following hooks are supported: 

       Name     translate_name      type_checker      quick_handler      map_to_storage      check_access      check_access_ex      insert_filter      check_authn      check_authz      fixups      handler      log_transaction     The default is  log_transaction . The special value
     all  is also supported, causing a message to be logged at each
    phase. Not all hooks are executed for every request. 

     The optional expression allows to restrict the message if a
    condition is met. The details of the expression syntax are described in
    the  ap_expr documentation . References to HTTP
    headers will not cause the header names to be added to the Vary header.
