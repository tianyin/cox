SSLSessionCache

Description:  Type of the global/inter-process SSL Session
Cache 
Syntax:   SSLSessionCache  type   
Default:   SSLSessionCache none  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

 
This configures the storage type of the global/inter-process SSL Session
Cache. This cache is an optional facility which speeds up parallel request
processing. For requests to the same server process (via HTTP keep-alive),
OpenSSL already caches the SSL session information locally. But because modern
clients request inlined images and other data via parallel requests (usually
up to four parallel requests are common) those requests are served by
 different  pre-forked server processes. Here an inter-process cache
helps to avoid unnecessary session handshakes. 
 
The following five storage  type s are currently supported: 
   none 

     This disables the global/inter-process Session Cache.  This
    will incur a noticeable speed penalty and may cause problems if
    using certain browsers, particularly if client certificates are
    enabled.  This setting is not recommended.  

  nonenotnull 

     This disables any global/inter-process Session Cache.  However
    it does force OpenSSL to send a non-null session ID to
    accommodate buggy clients that require one.  

  dbm:/path/to/datafile 

     This makes use of a DBM hashfile on the local disk to
    synchronize the local OpenSSL memory caches of the server
    processes. This session cache may suffer reliability issues under
    high load. To use this, ensure that
      mod_socache_dbm   is loaded.  

  shmcb:/path/to/datafile [ (  size  ) ]

     This makes use of a high-performance cyclic buffer
    (approx.  size  bytes in size) inside a shared memory
    segment in RAM (established via  /path/to/datafile ) to
    synchronize the local OpenSSL memory caches of the server
    processes.  This is the recommended session cache. To use this,
    ensure that   mod_socache_shmcb   is loaded.  

  dc:UNIX:/path/to/socket 

     This makes use of the  distcache  distributed session
    caching libraries.  The argument should specify the location of
    the server or proxy to be used using the distcache address syntax;
    for example,  UNIX:/path/to/socket  specifies a UNIX
    domain socket (typically a local dc_client proxy);
     IP:server.example.com:9001  specifies an IP
    address. To use this, ensure that
      mod_socache_dc   is loaded.  

   Examples  SSLSessionCache dbm:/usr/local/apache/logs/ssl_gcache_data
SSLSessionCache shmcb:/usr/local/apache/logs/ssl_gcache_data(512000) 
 

 The  ssl-cache  mutex is used to serialize access to
the session cache to prevent corruption.  This mutex can be configured
using the   Mutex   directive.
