Description:  Restrict access to the listed HTTP methods

Default:   AllowMethods reset

Status:  Experimental 
Module:  mod_allowmethods 

 The HTTP-methods are case sensitive, and are generally as per
RFC given in upper case. The GET and HEAD methods are treated as
equivalent. The  reset  keyword can be used
turn off   mod_allowmethods   in a deeper nested context: 

 < Location /svn >
   AllowMethods reset
< /Location > 


  Caution 
   The TRACE method can not be denied by this module,
  use   TraceEnable   instead. 
 

   mod_allowmethods   was written to replace the rather
kludgy implementation of   Limit   and
  LimitExcept  .
