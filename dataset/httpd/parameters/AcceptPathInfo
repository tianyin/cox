AcceptPathInfo

Description:  Resources accept trailing pathname information 
Syntax:   AcceptPathInfo On|Off|Default  
Default:   AcceptPathInfo Default  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 This directive controls whether requests that contain trailing
    pathname information that follows an actual filename (or
    non-existent file in an existing directory) will be accepted or
    rejected.  The trailing pathname information can be made
    available to scripts in the  PATH_INFO  environment
    variable. 

     For example, assume the location  /test/  points to
    a directory that contains only the single file
     here.html .  Then requests for
     /test/here.html/more  and
     /test/nothere.html/more  both collect
     /more  as  PATH_INFO . 

     The three possible arguments for the
     AcceptPathInfo  directive are: 
       Off   A request will only be accepted if it
    maps to a literal path that exists.  Therefore a request with
    trailing pathname information after the true filename such as
     /test/here.html/more  in the above example will return
    a 404 NOT FOUND error. 

      On   A request will be accepted if a
    leading path component maps to a file that exists.  The above
    example  /test/here.html/more  will be accepted if
     /test/here.html  maps to a valid file. 

      Default   The treatment of requests with
    trailing pathname information is determined by the  handler  responsible for the request.
    The core handler for normal files defaults to rejecting
     PATH_INFO  requests. Handlers that serve scripts, such as  cgi-script  and  isapi-handler , generally accept
     PATH_INFO  by default. 
      The primary purpose of the  AcceptPathInfo 
    directive is to allow you to override the handler's choice of
    accepting or rejecting  PATH_INFO . This override is required,
    for example, when you use a  filter , such
    as  INCLUDES , to generate content
    based on  PATH_INFO .  The core handler would usually reject
    the request, so you can use the following configuration to enable
    such a script: 

     < Files "mypaths.shtml" >
  Options +Includes
  SetOutputFilter INCLUDES
  AcceptPathInfo On
< /Files >
