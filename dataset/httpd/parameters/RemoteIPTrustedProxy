RemoteIPTrustedProxy

Description:  Declare client intranet IP addresses trusted to present the RemoteIPHeader value 
Syntax:   RemoteIPTrustedProxy  proxy-ip | proxy-ip/subnet | hostname  ...  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_remoteip 

 The   RemoteIPTrustedProxy   directive adds one
    or more addresses (or address blocks) to trust as presenting a valid
    RemoteIPHeader value of the useragent IP.  Unlike the
      RemoteIPInternalProxy   directive, any intranet
    or private IP address reported by such proxies, including the 10/8, 172.16/12,
    192.168/16, 169.254/16 and 127/8 blocks (or outside of the IPv6 public
    2000::/3 block) are not trusted as the useragent IP, and are left in the
      RemoteIPHeader   header's value.
