 The  LanguagePriority  sets the precedence
    of language variants for the case where the client does not
    express a preference, when handling a Multiviews request. The list
    of  MIME-lang  are in order of decreasing preference. 

     LanguagePriority en fr de 


     For a request for  foo.html , where
     foo.html.fr  and  foo.html.de  both
    existed, but the browser did not express a language preference,
    then  foo.html.fr  would be returned. 

     Note that this directive only has an effect if a 'best'
    language cannot be determined by any other means or the   ForceLanguagePriority   directive
    is not  None . In general, the client determines the
    language preference, not the server.
