AuthType

Description:  Type of user authentication 
Syntax:   AuthType None|Basic|Digest|Form  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_authn_core 

 This directive selects the type of user authentication for a
    directory. The authentication types available are  None ,
     Basic  (implemented by
      mod_auth_basic  ),  Digest 
    (implemented by   mod_auth_digest  ), and
     Form  (implemented by   mod_auth_form  ). 

     To implement authentication, you must also use the   AuthName   and   Require   directives.  In addition, the
    server must have an authentication-provider module such as
      mod_authn_file   and an authorization module such
    as   mod_authz_user  . 

     The authentication type  None  disables authentication.
    When authentication is enabled, it is normally inherited by each
    subsequent  configuration section ,
    unless a different authentication type is specified.  If no
    authentication is desired for a subsection of an authenticated
    section, the authentication type  None  may be used;
    in the following example, clients may access the
     /www/docs/public  directory without authenticating: 

     < Directory /www/docs >
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName Documents
    AuthBasicProvider file
    AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/passwd/passwords
    Require valid-user
< /Directory >

< Directory /www/docs/public >
    AuthType None
    Require all granted
< /Directory > 


     When disabling authentication, note that clients which have
    already authenticated against another portion of the server's document
    tree will typically continue to send authentication HTTP headers
    or cookies with each request, regardless of whether the server
    actually requires authentication for every resource.
