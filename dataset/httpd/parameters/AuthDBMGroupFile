AuthDBMGroupFile

Description:  Sets the name of the database file containing the list
of user groups for authorization 
Syntax:   AuthDBMGroupFile  file-path   
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_authz_dbm 

 The  AuthDBMGroupFile  directive sets the
    name of a DBM file containing the list of user groups for user
    authorization.   File-path  is the absolute path to the
    group file. 

     The group file is keyed on the username. The value for a
    user is a comma-separated list of the groups to which the users
    belongs. There must be no whitespace within the value, and it
    must never contain any colons. 

      Security 
       Make sure that the  AuthDBMGroupFile  is
      stored outside the document tree of the web-server. Do
       not  put it in the directory that it protects.
      Otherwise, clients will be able to download the
       AuthDBMGroupFile  unless otherwise
      protected. 
     

     Combining Group and Password DBM files: In some cases it is
    easier to manage a single database which contains both the
    password and group details for each user. This simplifies any
    support programs that need to be written: they now only have to
    deal with writing to and locking a single DBM file. This can be
    accomplished by first setting the group and password files to
    point to the same DBM: 

     AuthDBMGroupFile /www/userbase
AuthDBMUserFile /www/userbase 


     The key for the single DBM is the username. The value consists
    of 

       
      Encrypted Password : List of Groups [ : (ignored) ]
       

     The password section contains the encrypted
    password as before. This is followed by a colon and the comma
    separated list of groups. Other data may optionally be left in the
    DBM file after another colon; it is ignored by the authorization
    module. This is what www.telescope.org uses for its combined
    password and group database.
