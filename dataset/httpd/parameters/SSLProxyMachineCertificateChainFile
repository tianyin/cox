This directive sets the all-in-one file where you keep the certificate chain
for all of the client certs in use. This directive will be needed if the
remote server presents a list of CA certificates that are not direct signers
of one of the configured client certificates.
 
 
This referenced file is simply the concatenation of the various PEM-encoded
certificate files. Upon startup, each client certificate configured will
be examined and a chain of trust will be constructed.
 
  Security warning 
 If this directive is enabled, all of the certificates in the file will be
trusted as if they were also in   
SSLProxyCACertificateFile  . 
 
  Example  SSLProxyMachineCertificateChainFile /usr/local/apache2/conf/ssl.crt/proxyCA.pem
