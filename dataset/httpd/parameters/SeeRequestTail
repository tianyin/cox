SeeRequestTail

Description:  Determine if mod_status displays the first 63 characters
of a request or the last 63, assuming the request itself is greater than
63 chars. 
Syntax:   SeeRequestTail On|Off  
Default:   SeeRequestTail Off  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache httpd 2.2.7 and later. 

 mod_status with  ExtendedStatus On 
    displays the actual request being handled.
    For historical purposes, only 63 characters of the request
    are actually stored for display purposes. This directive
    controls whether the 1st 63 characters are stored (the previous
    behavior and the default) or if the last 63 characters are. This
    is only applicable, of course, if the length of the request is
    64 characters or greater. 

     If Apache httpd is handling  GET&#160;/disk1/storage/apache/htdocs/images/imagestore1/food/apples.jpg&#160;HTTP/1.1  mod_status displays as follows:
     

       Off (default) 
         GET&#160;/disk1/storage/apache/htdocs/images/imagestore1/food/apples 
         On 
         orage/apache/htdocs/images/imagestore1/food/apples.jpg&#160;HTTP/1.1
