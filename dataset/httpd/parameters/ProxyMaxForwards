ProxyMaxForwards

Description:  Maximium number of proxies that a request can be forwarded
through 
Syntax:   ProxyMaxForwards  number   
Default:   ProxyMaxForwards -1  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 
Compatibility:  Default behaviour changed in 2.2.7 

 The  ProxyMaxForwards  directive specifies the
    maximum number of proxies through which a request may pass, if there's no
     Max-Forwards  header supplied with the request. This may
    be set to prevent infinite proxy loops, or a DoS attack. 

      Example  ProxyMaxForwards 15 
 

     Note that setting  ProxyMaxForwards  is a
    violation of the HTTP/1.1 protocol (RFC2616), which forbids a Proxy
    setting  Max-Forwards  if the Client didn't set it.
    Earlier Apache httpd versions would always set it.  A negative
     ProxyMaxForwards  value, including the
    default -1, gives you protocol-compliant behaviour, but may
    leave you open to loops.
