ModMimeUsePathInfo

Description:  Tells   mod_mime   to treat  path_info 
components as part of the filename 
Syntax:   ModMimeUsePathInfo On|Off  
Default:   ModMimeUsePathInfo Off  
Context:  directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_mime 

 The  ModMimeUsePathInfo  directive is used to
    combine the filename with the  path_info  URL component to
    apply   mod_mime  's directives to the request. The default
    value is  Off  - therefore, the  path_info 
    component is ignored. 

     This directive is recommended when you have a virtual filesystem. 

      Example  ModMimeUsePathInfo On 
 

     If you have a request for  /index.php/foo.shtml 
      mod_mime   will now treat the
    incoming request as  /index.php/foo.shtml  and directives
    like  AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml  will add the
     INCLUDES  filter to the request. If  ModMimeUsePathInfo  is not set, the
     INCLUDES  filter will not be added. This will work
    analogously for virtual paths, such as those defined by
     < Location >
