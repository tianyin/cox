KeepAliveTimeout

Description:  Amount of time the server will wait for subsequent
requests on a persistent connection 
Syntax:   KeepAliveTimeout  num [ms]  
Default:   KeepAliveTimeout 5  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 The number of seconds Apache httpd will wait for a subsequent
    request before closing the connection. By adding a postfix of ms the
    timeout can be also set in milliseconds. Once a request has been
    received, the timeout value specified by the
      Timeout   directive applies. 

     Setting  KeepAliveTimeout  to a high value
    may cause performance problems in heavily loaded servers. The
    higher the timeout, the more server processes will be kept
    occupied waiting on connections with idle clients. 

     In a name-based virtual host context, the value of the first
    defined virtual host best matching the local IP and port will be used.
