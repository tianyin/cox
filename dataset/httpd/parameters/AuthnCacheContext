AuthnCacheContext

Description:  Specify a context string for use in the cache key 
Syntax:   AuthnCacheContext  directory|server|custom-string   
Default:   directory  
Context:  directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_authn_socache 

 This directive specifies a string to be used along with the supplied
    username (and realm in the case of Digest Authentication) in constructing
    a cache key.  This serves to disambiguate identical usernames serving
    different authentication areas on the server. 
     Two special values for this are  directory , which uses
    the directory context of the request as a string, and  server 
    which uses the virtual host name. 
     The default is  directory , which is also the most
    conservative setting.  This is likely to be less than optimal, as it
    (for example) causes  $app-base ,  $app-base/images ,
     $app-base/scripts  and  $app-base/media  each to
    have its own separate cache key.  A better policy is to name the
     AuthnCacheContext  for the password
    provider: for example a  htpasswd  file or database table. 
     Contexts can be shared across different areas of a server, where
    credentials are shared.  However, this has potential to become a vector
    for cross-site or cross-application security breaches, so this directive
    is not permitted in  .htaccess  contexts.
