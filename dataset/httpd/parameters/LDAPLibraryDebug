LDAPLibraryDebug

Description:  Enable debugging in the LDAP SDK 
Syntax:   LDAPLibraryDebug  7   
Default:   disabled  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ldap 

 Turns on SDK-specific LDAP debug options that generally cause the LDAP
    SDK to log verbose trace information to the main Apache error log.
    The trace messages from the LDAP SDK provide gory details that
    can be useful during debugging of connectivity problems with backend LDAP servers 

     This option is only configurable when Apache HTTP Server is linked with
    an LDAP SDK that implements  LDAP_OPT_DEBUG  or
     LDAP_OPT_DEBUG_LEVEL , such as OpenLDAP (a value of 7 is verbose)
    or Tivoli Directory Server (a value of 65535 is verbose). 

     
     The logged information will likely contain plaintext credentials being used or
    validated by LDAP authentication, so care should be taken in protecting and purging
    the error log when this directive is used.
