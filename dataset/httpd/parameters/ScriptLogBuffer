ScriptLogBuffer

Description:  Maximum amount of PUT or POST requests that will be recorded
in the scriptlog 
Syntax:   ScriptLogBuffer  bytes   
Default:   ScriptLogBuffer 1024  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Base 
Module:    mod_cgi  ,   mod_cgid   

 The size of any PUT or POST entity body that is logged to
    the file is limited, to prevent the log file growing too big
    too quickly if large bodies are being received. By default, up
    to 1024 bytes are logged, but this can be changed with this
    directive.
