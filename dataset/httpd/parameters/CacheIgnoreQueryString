Description:  Ignore query string when caching 
Syntax:   CacheIgnoreQueryString On|Off  
Default:   CacheIgnoreQueryString Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache 

 Ordinarily, requests with query string parameters are cached separately
    for each unique query string. This is according to RFC 2616/13.9 done only
    if an expiration time is specified. The
     CacheIgnoreQueryString  directive tells the cache to
    cache requests even if no expiration time is specified, and to reply with
    a cached reply even if the query string differs. From a caching point of
    view the request is treated as if having no query string when this
    directive is enabled.
