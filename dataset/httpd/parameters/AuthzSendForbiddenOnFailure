AuthzSendForbiddenOnFailure

Description:  Send '403 FORBIDDEN' instead of '401 UNAUTHORIZED' if
authentication succeeds but authorization fails
 
Syntax:   AuthzSendForbiddenOnFailure On|Off  
Default:   AuthzSendForbiddenOnFailure Off  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_authz_core 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache HTTPD 2.3.11 and later 

 If authentication succeeds but authorization fails, Apache HTTPD will
    respond with an HTTP response code of '401 UNAUTHORIZED' by default. This
    usually causes browsers to display the password dialogue to the user
    again, which is not wanted in all situations.
     AuthzSendForbiddenOnFailure  allows to change the
    response code to '403 FORBIDDEN'. 

      Security Warning 
     Modifying the response in case of missing authorization weakens the
    security of the password, because it reveals to a possible attacker, that
    his guessed password was right.
