AuthDBDUserRealmQuery

Description:  SQL query to look up a password hash for a user and realm.
 
Syntax:   AuthDBDUserRealmQuery  query   
Context:  directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_authn_dbd 

 The  AuthDBDUserRealmQuery  specifies an
    SQL query to look up a password for a specified user and realm in a
    digest authentication process.
    The user's ID and the realm, in that order, will be passed as string
    parameters when the SQL query is executed.  They may be referenced
    within the query statement using  %s  format specifiers. 
     AuthDBDUserRealmQuery "SELECT password FROM authn WHERE user = %s AND realm = %s" 

     The first column value of the first row returned by the query
    statement should be a string containing the encrypted password.
    Subsequent rows will be ignored.  If no rows are returned, the user
    will not be authenticated through   mod_authn_dbd  . 
     If httpd was built against  APR  version 1.3.0
    or higher, any additional column values in the first row returned by
    the query statement will be stored as environment variables with
    names of the form  AUTHENTICATE_ COLUMN  .
     
     The encrypted password format depends on which authentication
    frontend (e.g.   mod_auth_basic   or
      mod_auth_digest  ) is being used.  See  Password Formats  for
    more information.
