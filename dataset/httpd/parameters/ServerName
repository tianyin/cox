ServerName

Description:  Hostname and port that the server uses to identify
itself 
Syntax:   ServerName [ scheme ://] fully-qualified-domain-name [: port ]  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 The  ServerName  directive sets the
    request scheme, hostname and
    port that the server uses to identify itself.  This is used when
    creating redirection URLs. 

     Additionally,  ServerName  is used (possibly
    in conjunction with  ServerAlias ) to uniquely
    identify a virtual host, when using  name-based virtual hosts . 

     For example, if the name of the
    machine hosting the web server is  simple.example.com ,
    but the machine also has the DNS alias  www.example.com 
    and you wish the web server to be so identified, the following
    directive should be used: 

     ServerName www.example.com 


     The  ServerName  directive
    may appear anywhere within the definition of a server. However,
    each appearance overrides the previous appearance (within that
    server). 

     If no  ServerName  is specified, then the
    server attempts to deduce the hostname by performing a reverse
    lookup on the IP address. If no port is specified in the
     ServerName , then the server will use the
    port from the incoming request. For optimal reliability and
    predictability, you should specify an explicit hostname and port
    using the  ServerName  directive. 

     If you are using  name-based virtual hosts ,
    the  ServerName  inside a
      < VirtualHost >  
    section specifies what hostname must appear in the request's
     Host:  header to match this virtual host. 

     Sometimes, the server runs behind a device that processes SSL,
    such as a reverse proxy, load balancer or SSL offload
    appliance. When this is the case, specify the
     https://  scheme and the port number to which the
    clients connect in the  ServerName  directive
    to make sure that the server generates the correct
    self-referential URLs.
     

     See the description of the
      UseCanonicalName   and
      UseCanonicalPhysicalPort   directives for
    settings which determine whether self-referential URLs (e.g., by the
      mod_dir   module) will refer to the
    specified port, or to the port number given in the client's request.
     

     
     Failure to set  ServerName  to a name that
    your server can resolve to an IP address will result in a startup
    warning.  httpd  will then use whatever hostname it can
    determine, using the system's  hostname  command. This
    will almost never be the hostname you actually want.
