This directive sets the directory where you keep the certificates and
keys used for authentication of the proxy server to remote servers.
 
 The files in this directory must be PEM-encoded and are accessed through
hash filenames. Additionally, you must create symbolic links named
  hash-value .N . And you should always make sure this
directory contains the appropriate symbolic links. 
 
 Currently there is no support for encrypted private keys
