LuaMapHandler

Description:  Map a path to a lua handler 
Syntax:   LuaMapHandler uri-pattern /path/to/lua/script.lua [function-name]  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  All 
Status:  Experimental 
Module:  mod_lua 

 This directive matches a uri pattern to invoke a specific
    handler function in a specific file. It uses PCRE regular
    expressions to match the uri, and supports interpolating
    match groups into both the file path and the function name. 
    Be careful writing your regular expressions to avoid security
    issues. 
     Examples:  LuaMapHandler /(\w+)/(\w+) /scripts/$1.lua handle_$2 
 
         This would match uri's such as /photos/show?id=9
        to the file /scripts/photos.lua and invoke the
        handler function handle_show on the lua vm after
        loading that file. 

 LuaMapHandler /bingo /scripts/wombat.lua 

         This would invoke the "handle" function, which
        is the default if no specific function name is
        provided.
