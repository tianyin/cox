ProxyVia

Description:  Information provided in the  Via  HTTP response
header for proxied requests 
Syntax:   ProxyVia On|Off|Full|Block  
Default:   ProxyVia Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 

 This directive controls the use of the  Via:  HTTP
    header by the proxy. Its intended use is to control the flow of
    proxy requests along a chain of proxy servers.  See  RFC 2616  (HTTP/1.1), section
    14.45 for an explanation of  Via:  header lines. 

      If set to  Off , which is the default, no special processing
    is performed. If a request or reply contains a  Via:  header,
    it is passed through unchanged. 

     If set to  On , each request and reply will get a
     Via:  header line added for the current host. 

     If set to  Full , each generated  Via:  header
    line will additionally have the Apache httpd server version shown as a
     Via:  comment field. 

     If set to  Block , every proxy request will have all its
     Via:  header lines removed. No new  Via:  header will
    be generated.
