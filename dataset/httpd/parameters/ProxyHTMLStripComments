ProxyHTMLStripComments

Description:  Determines whether to strip HTML comments. 
Syntax:   ProxyHTMLStripComments  On|Off   
Default:   ProxyHTMLStripComments Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_proxy_html 
Compatibility:  Version 2.4 and later; available as a third-party
for earlier 2.x versions 

 This directive will cause mod_proxy_html to strip HTML comments.
Note that this will also kill off any scripts or styles embedded in
comments (a bogosity introduced in 1995/6 with Netscape 2 for the
benefit of then-older browsers, but still in use today).
It may also interfere with comment-based processors such as SSI or ESI:
be sure to run any of those  before  mod_proxy_html in the
filter chain if stripping comments!
