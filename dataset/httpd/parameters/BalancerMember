BalancerMember

Description:  Add a member to a load balancing group 
Syntax:   BalancerMember [ balancerurl ]  url  [ key=value [key=value ...]]   
Context:  directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 
Compatibility:  BalancerMember is only available in Apache HTTP Server 2.2
        and later. 

 This directive adds a member to a load balancing group. It could be used
            within a  < Proxy  balancer:// ... >  container
            directive, and can take any of the key value pair parameters available to
              ProxyPass   directives. 
         One additional parameter is available only to  BalancerMember  directives:
             loadfactor . This is the member load factor - a number between 1
            (default) and 100, which defines the weighted load to be applied to the
            member in question. 
         The  balancerurl  is only needed when not in
             < Proxy  balancer:// ... > 
            container directive. It corresponds to the url of a balancer defined in
              ProxyPass   directive. 
         The path component of the balancer URL in any
             < Proxy  balancer:// ... >  container directive
            is ignored. 
         Trailing slashes should typically be removed from the URL of a
             BalancerMember .
