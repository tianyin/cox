AuthMerging

Description:  Controls the manner in which each configuration section's
authorization logic is combined with that of preceding configuration
sections. 
Syntax:   AuthMerging Off | And | Or  
Default:   AuthMerging Off  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_authz_core 

 When authorization is enabled, it is normally inherited by each
    subsequent  configuration section ,
    unless a different set of authorization directives is specified.
    This is the default action, which corresponds to an explicit setting
    of  AuthMerging Off . 

     However, there may be circumstances in which it is desirable
    for a configuration section's authorization to be combined with
    that of its predecessor while configuration sections are being
    merged.  Two options are available for this case,  And 
    and  Or . 

     When a configuration section contains  AuthMerging And 
    or  AuthMerging Or ,
    its authorization logic is combined with that of the nearest
    predecessor (according to the overall order of configuration sections)
    which also contains authorization logic as if the two sections
    were jointly contained within a
      < RequireAll >   or
      < RequireAny >  
    directive, respectively. 

     The setting of  AuthMerging  is not
    inherited outside of the configuration section in which it appears.
    In the following example, only users belonging to group  alpha 
    may access  /www/docs .  Users belonging to either
    groups  alpha  or  beta  may access
     /www/docs/ab .  However, the default  Off 
    setting of  AuthMerging  applies to the
      < Directory >  
    configuration section for  /www/docs/ab/gamma , so
    that section's authorization directives override those of the
    preceding sections.  Thus only users belong to the group
     gamma  may access  /www/docs/ab/gamma . 

     < Directory /www/docs >
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName Documents
    AuthBasicProvider file
    AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/passwd/passwords
    Require group alpha
< /Directory >

< Directory /www/docs/ab >
    AuthMerging Or
    Require group beta
< /Directory >

< Directory /www/docs/ab/gamma >
    Require group gamma
< /Directory >
