MaxSpareServers

Description:  Maximum number of idle child server processes 
Syntax:   MaxSpareServers  number   
Default:   MaxSpareServers 10  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:  prefork 

 The  MaxSpareServers  directive sets the
    desired maximum number of  idle  child server processes. An
    idle process is one which is not handling a request. If there are
    more than  MaxSpareServers  idle, then the
    parent process will kill off the excess processes. 

     Tuning of this parameter should only be necessary on very
    busy sites. Setting this parameter to a large number is almost
    always a bad idea. If you are trying to set the value equal to or lower than
      MinSpareServers  , Apache HTTP Server
    will automatically adjust it to  MinSpareServers   + 1 .
