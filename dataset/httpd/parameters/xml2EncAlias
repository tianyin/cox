xml2EncAlias

Description:  Recognise Aliases for encoding values 
Syntax:   xml2EncAlias  charset alias [alias ...]   
Context:  server config 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_xml2enc 

 This server-wide directive aliases one or more encoding to another
    encoding.  This enables encodings not recognised by libxml2 to be handled
    internally by libxml2's encoding support using the translation table for
    a recognised encoding.  This serves two purposes: to support character sets
    (or names) not recognised either by libxml2 or iconv, and to skip
    conversion for an encoding where it is known to be unnecessary.
