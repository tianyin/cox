LimitInternalRecursion

Description:  Determine maximum number of internal redirects and nested
subrequests 
Syntax:   LimitInternalRecursion  number  [ number ]  
Default:   LimitInternalRecursion 10  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 An internal redirect happens, for example, when using the   Action   directive, which internally
    redirects the original request to a CGI script. A subrequest is Apache httpd's
    mechanism to find out what would happen for some URI if it were requested.
    For example,   mod_dir   uses subrequests to look for the
    files listed in the   DirectoryIndex  
    directive. 

      LimitInternalRecursion  prevents the server
    from crashing when entering an infinite loop of internal redirects or
    subrequests. Such loops are usually caused by misconfigurations. 

     The directive stores two different limits, which are evaluated on
    per-request basis. The first  number  is the maximum number of
    internal redirects, that may follow each other. The second  number 
    determines, how deep subrequests may be nested. If you specify only one
     number , it will be assigned to both limits.
