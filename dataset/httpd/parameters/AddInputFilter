AddInputFilter

Description:  Maps filename extensions to the filters that will process
client requests 
Syntax:   AddInputFilter  filter [; filter ...]
 extension  [ extension ] ...  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_mime 

  AddInputFilter  maps the filename extension
     extension  to the  filters  which
    will process client requests and POST input when they are received by
    the server. This is in addition to any filters defined elsewhere,
    including the   SetInputFilter  
    directive. This mapping is merged over any already in force, overriding
    any mappings that already exist for the same  extension . 

     If more than one  filter  is specified, they must be separated
    by semicolons in the order in which they should process the
    content. The  filter  is case-insensitive. 

     The  extension  argument is case-insensitive and can
    be specified with or without a leading dot. Filenames may have  multiple extensions  and the
     extension  argument will be compared against each of
    them.
