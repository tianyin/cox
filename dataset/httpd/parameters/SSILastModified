SSILastModified

Description:  Controls whether  Last-Modified  headers are generated by the
server. 
Syntax:   SSILastModified on|off  
Default:   SSILastModified off  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_include 
Compatibility:  Available in version 2.2.15 and later. 

 Under normal circumstances, a file filtered by   mod_include  
        may contain elements that are either dynamically generated, or that may
        have changed independently of the original file. As a result, by default
        the  Last-Modified  header is stripped from the response. 

       The  SSILastModified  directive overrides this
        behaviour, and allows the  Last-Modified  header to be respected
        if already present, or set if the header is not already present. This can
        be used to enable caching of the output.  SSILastModified 
        can take on the following values: 

         off  
         The  Last-Modified  header will be stripped from responses,
          unless the   XBitHack   directive
          is set to  full  as described below. 

          on  
         The  Last-Modified  header will be respected if already
          present in a response, and added to the response if the response is a
          file and the header is missing. The
            SSILastModified   directive
          takes precedence over   XBitHack  .
