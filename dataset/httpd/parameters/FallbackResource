FallbackResource

Description:  Define a default URL for requests that don't map to a file 
Syntax:   FallbackResource disabled |  local-url   
Default:   disabled - httpd will return 404 (Not Found)  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  Indexes 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_dir 
Compatibility:  The  disabled  argument is available in version 2.4.4 and
later 

 Use this to set a handler for any URL that doesn't map to anything
    in your filesystem, and would otherwise return HTTP 404 (Not Found).
    For example 
     FallbackResource /not-404.php 

     will cause requests for non-existent files to be handled by
     not-404.php , while requests for files that exist
    are unaffected. 
     It is frequently desirable to have a single file or resource
    handle all requests to a particular directory, except those requests
    that correspond to an existing file or script. This is often
    referred to as a 'front controller.' 
     In earlier versions of httpd, this effect typically required
      mod_rewrite  , and the use of the  -f  and
     -d  tests for file and directory existence. This now
    requires only one line of configuration. 
     FallbackResource /index.php 

     Existing files, such as images, css files, and so on, will be
    served normally. 
     Use the  disabled  argument to disable that feature
    if inheritance from a parent directory is not desired. 
     In a sub-URI, such as  http://example.com/blog/  this
     sub-URI  has to be supplied as  local-url : 
     < Directory /web/example.com/htdocs/blog >
    FallbackResource /blog/index.php
< /Directory >
< Directory /web/example.com/htdocs/blog/images >
    FallbackResource disabled
< /Directory >
