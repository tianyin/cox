ProxyHTMLExtended

Description:  Determines whether to fix links in inline scripts, stylesheets,
and scripting events. 
Syntax:   ProxyHTMLExtended  On|Off   
Default:   ProxyHTMLExtended Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_proxy_html 
Compatibility:  Version 2.4 and later; available as a third-party
for earlier 2.x versions 

 Set to  Off , HTML links are rewritten according to the
 ProxyHTMLURLMap  directives, but links appearing
in Javascript and CSS are ignored. 
 Set to  On , all scripting events (as determined by
 ProxyHTMLEvents ) and embedded scripts or
stylesheets are also processed by the  ProxyHTMLURLMap 
rules, according to the flags set for each rule.  Since this requires more
parsing, performance will be best if you only enable it when strictly necessary.
  
You'll also need to take care over patterns matched, since the parser has no
knowledge of what is a URL within an embedded script or stylesheet.
In particular, extended matching of  /  is likely to lead to
false matches.
