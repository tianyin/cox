ProxyFtpEscapeWildcards

Description:  Whether wildcards in requested filenames are escaped when sent to the FTP server 
Syntax:   ProxyFtpEscapeWildcards [on|off]  
Default:   on  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy_ftp 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache 2.3.3 and later 

 The  ProxyFtpEscapeWildcards  directive
    controls whether wildcard characters ("*?[{~") in requested
    filenames are escaped with backslash before sending them to the
    FTP server.  That is the default behavior, but many FTP servers
    don't know about the escaping and try to serve the literal filenames
    they were sent, including the backslashes in the names.   
     Set to "off" to allow downloading files with wildcards
    in their names from FTP servers that don't understand wildcard
    escaping.
