CacheEnable

Description:  Enable caching of specified URLs using a specified storage
manager 
Syntax:   CacheEnable  cache_type  [ url-string ]  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache 
Compatibility:  A url-string of '/' applied to forward proxy content in 2.2 and
 earlier. 

 The  CacheEnable  directive instructs
      mod_cache   to cache urls at or below
     url-string . The cache storage manager is specified with the
     cache_type  argument. The  CacheEnable 
    directive can alternatively be placed inside either
     < Location >  or
     < LocationMatch >  sections to indicate
    the content is cacheable.
     cache_type   disk  instructs
      mod_cache   to use the disk based storage manager
    implemented by   mod_cache_disk  .  cache_type 
     socache  instructs   mod_cache   to use the
    shared object cache based storage manager implemented by
      mod_cache_socache  . 
     In the event that the URL space overlaps between different
     CacheEnable  directives (as in the example below),
    each possible storage manager will be run until the first one that
    actually processes the request. The order in which the storage managers are
    run is determined by the order of the  CacheEnable 
    directives in the configuration file.  CacheEnable 
    directives within  < Location >  or
     < LocationMatch >  sections are processed
    before globally defined  CacheEnable  directives. 

     When acting as a forward proxy server,  url-string  must
    minimally begin with a protocol for which caching should be enabled. 

     # Cache content (normal handler only)
CacheQuickHandler off
< Location /foo >
    CacheEnable disk
< /Location >

# Cache regex (normal handler only)
CacheQuickHandler off
< LocationMatch foo$ >
    CacheEnable disk
< /LocationMatch >

# Cache all but forward proxy url's (normal or quick handler)
CacheEnable  disk  /

# Cache FTP-proxied url's (normal or quick handler)
CacheEnable  disk  ftp://

# Cache forward proxy content from www.example.org (normal or quick handler)
CacheEnable  disk  http://www.example.org/ 


     A hostname starting with a  "*"  matches all hostnames with
    that suffix. A hostname starting with  "."  matches all
    hostnames containing the domain components that follow. 

     # Match www.example.org, and fooexample.org
CacheEnable  disk  http://*example.org/
# Match www.example.org, but not fooexample.org
CacheEnable  disk  http://.example.org/ 


      The  no-cache  environment variable can be set to
    disable caching on a finer grained set of resources in versions
    2.2.12 and later.
