SSLCryptoDevice

Description:  Enable use of a cryptographic hardware accelerator 
Syntax:   SSLCryptoDevice  engine   
Default:   SSLCryptoDevice builtin  
Context:  server config 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

 
This directive enables use of a cryptographic hardware accelerator
board to offload some of the SSL processing overhead.  This directive
can only be used if the SSL toolkit is built with "engine" support;
OpenSSL 0.9.7 and later releases have "engine" support by default, the
separate "-engine" releases of OpenSSL 0.9.6 must be used. 

 To discover which engine names are supported, run the command
" openssl engine ". 

  Example  # For a Broadcom accelerator:
SSLCryptoDevice ubsec
