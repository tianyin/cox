SSIStartTag

Description:  String that starts an include element 
Syntax:   SSIStartTag  tag   
Default:   SSIStartTag "< !--#"  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_include 

 This directive changes the string that   mod_include  
    looks for to mark an include element to process. 

     You may want to use this option if you have 2 servers parsing the
    output of a file each processing different commands (possibly at
    different times). 

           SSIStartTag "< %" 
      SSIEndTag   "% >" 


     The example given above, which also specifies a matching
      SSIEndTag  , will
    allow you to use SSI directives as shown in the example
    below: 

      SSI directives with alternate start and end tags   
      < %printenv % >
