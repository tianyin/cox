LuaQuickHandler

Description:  Provide a hook for the quick handler of request processing 
Syntax:   LuaQuickHandler /path/to/script.lua hook_function_name  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Override:  All 
Status:  Experimental 
Module:  mod_lua 

 
    This phase is run immediately after the request has been mapped to a virtal host, 
    and can be used to either do some request processing before the other phases kick 
    in, or to serve a request without the need to translate, map to storage et cetera. 
    As this phase is run before anything else, directives such as   < Location >   or   < Directory >   are void in this phase, just as 
    URIs have not been properly parsed yet.
     
     Context  This directive is not valid in   < Directory >  ,   < Files >  , or htaccess
   context.
