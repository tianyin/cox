MaxKeepAliveRequests

Description:  Number of requests allowed on a persistent
connection 
Syntax:   MaxKeepAliveRequests  number   
Default:   MaxKeepAliveRequests 100  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 The  MaxKeepAliveRequests  directive
    limits the number of requests allowed per connection when
      KeepAlive   is on. If it is
    set to  0 , unlimited requests will be allowed. We
    recommend that this setting be kept to a high value for maximum
    server performance. 

     For example: 

     MaxKeepAliveRequests 500
