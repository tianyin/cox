AuthFormSitePassphrase

Description:  Bypass authentication checks for high traffic sites 
Syntax:   AuthFormSitePassphrase  secret   
Default:   none  
Context:  directory 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_auth_form 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.3.0 and later 

 The   AuthFormSitePassphrase   directive
    specifies a passphrase which, if present in the user session, causes Apache httpd to
    bypass authentication checks for the given URL. It can be used on high traffic websites
    to reduce the load induced on authentication infrastructure. 

     The passphrase can be inserted into a user session by adding this directive to the
    configuration for the  form-login-handler . The  form-login-handler 
    itself will always run the authentication checks, regardless of whether a passphrase
    is specified or not. 

      Warning 
       If the session is exposed to the user through the use of
        mod_session_cookie  , and the session is not protected with
        mod_session_crypto  , the passphrase is open to potential exposure
      through a dictionary attack. Regardless of how the session is configured,
      ensure that this directive is not used within URL spaces where private user data
      could be exposed, or sensitive transactions can be conducted. Use at own risk.
