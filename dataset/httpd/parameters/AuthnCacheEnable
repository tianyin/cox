AuthnCacheEnable

Description:  Enable Authn caching configured anywhere 
Syntax:   AuthnCacheEnable  
Context:  server config 
Override:  None 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_authn_socache 

 This directive is not normally necessary: it is implied if
    authentication cacheing is enabled anywhere in  httpd.conf .
    However, if it is not enabled anywhere in  httpd.conf 
    it will by default not be initialised, and is therefore not
    available in a  .htaccess  context.  This directive
    ensures it is initialised so it can be used in  .htaccess .
