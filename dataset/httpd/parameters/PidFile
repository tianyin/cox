PidFile

Description:  File where the server records the process ID
of the daemon 
Syntax:   PidFile  filename   
Default:   PidFile logs/httpd.pid  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:    event  ,   mpm_winnt  ,   mpmt_os2  ,   prefork  ,   worker   

 The  PidFile  directive sets the file to
    which the server records the process id of the daemon. If the
    filename is not absolute then it is assumed to be relative to the
      ServerRoot  . 

      Example  PidFile /var/run/apache.pid 
 

     It is often useful to be able to send the server a signal,
    so that it closes and then re-opens its   ErrorLog   and   TransferLog  , and
    re-reads its configuration files. This is done by sending a
    SIGHUP (kill -1) signal to the process id listed in the
     PidFile . 

     The  PidFile  is subject to the same
    warnings about log file placement and  security . 

      Note 
       As of Apache HTTP Server 2, we recommended that you only use the   apachectl   script, or the init script that your OS provides,
      for (re-)starting or stopping the server.
