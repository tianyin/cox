CacheSocacheMaxSize

Description:  The maximum size (in bytes) of an entry to be placed in the
cache 
Syntax:   CacheSocacheMaxSize  bytes   
Default:   CacheSocacheMaxSize 102400  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache_socache 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache 2.4.5 and later 

 The  CacheSocacheMaxSize  directive sets the
    maximum size, in bytes, for the combined headers and body of a document
    to be considered for storage in the cache. The larger the headers that
    are stored alongside the body, the smaller the body may be. 

     The   mod_cache_socache   module will only attempt to
    cache responses that have an explicit content length, or that are small
    enough to be written in one pass. This is done to allow the
      mod_cache_disk   module to have an opportunity to cache
    responses larger than those cacheable within
      mod_cache_socache  .
