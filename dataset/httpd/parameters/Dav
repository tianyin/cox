Dav

Description:  Enable WebDAV HTTP methods 
Syntax:   Dav On|Off| provider-name   
Default:   Dav Off  
Context:  directory 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_dav 

 Use the  Dav  directive to enable the
    WebDAV HTTP methods for the given container: 

     < Location /foo >
    Dav On
< /Location > 


     The value  On  is actually an alias for the default
    provider  filesystem  which is served by the   mod_dav_fs   module. Note, that once you have DAV enabled
    for some location, it  cannot  be disabled for sublocations.
    For a complete configuration example have a look at the  section above . 

     
      Do not enable WebDAV until you have secured your server. Otherwise
      everyone will be able to distribute files on your system.
