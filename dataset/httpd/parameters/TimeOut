 The  TimeOut  directive defines the length
    of time Apache httpd will wait for I/O in various circumstances: 

      When reading data from the client, the length of time to
      wait for a TCP packet to arrive if the read buffer is
      empty. 

       When writing data to the client, the length of time to wait
      for an acknowledgement of a packet if the send buffer is
      full. 

       In   mod_cgi  , the length of time to wait for
      output from a CGI script. 

       In   mod_ext_filter  , the length of time to
      wait for output from a filtering process. 

       In   mod_proxy  , the default timeout value if
        ProxyTimeout   is not
      configured.
