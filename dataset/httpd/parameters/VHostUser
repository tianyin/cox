VHostUser

Description:  Sets the User ID under which a virtual host runs. 
Syntax:   VHostUser  unix-userid   
Default:   Inherits the userid specified in
  User    
Context:  virtual host 
Status:  Experimental 
Module:  mod_privileges 
Compatibility:  Available on Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris with
non-threaded MPMs (  prefork   or custom MPM). 

 The  VHostUser  directive sets the Unix userid
    under which the server will process requests to a virtualhost.
    The userid is set before the request is processed and reset afterwards
    using  Solaris Privileges .  Since the setting applies to the
     process , this is not compatible with threaded MPMs. 
      Unix-userid  is one of: 
      A username 
       Refers to the given user by name. 

        #  followed by a user number. 
       Refers to a user by its number. 
       Security 
     This directive cannot be used to run apache as root!
    Nevertheless, it opens potential security issues similar to
    those discussed in the  suexec 
    documentation.
