SSLProxyEngine

Description:  SSL Proxy Engine Operation Switch 
Syntax:   SSLProxyEngine on|off  
Default:   SSLProxyEngine off  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

 
This directive toggles the usage of the SSL/TLS Protocol Engine for proxy. This
is usually used inside a   < VirtualHost >   section to enable SSL/TLS for proxy
usage in a particular virtual host. By default the SSL/TLS Protocol Engine is
disabled for proxy both for the main server and all configured virtual hosts. 

 Note that the SSLProxyEngine directive should not, in
general, be included in a virtual host that will be acting as a
forward proxy (using < Proxy > or < ProxyRequest > directives.
SSLProxyEngine is not required to enable a forward proxy server to
proxy SSL/TLS requests. 

  Example  < VirtualHost _default_:443 >
    SSLProxyEngine on
    #...
< /VirtualHost >
