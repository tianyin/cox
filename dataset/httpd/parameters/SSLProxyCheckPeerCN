This directive sets whether the remote server certificate's CN field is
compared against the hostname of the request URL. If both are not equal
a 502 status code (Bad Gateway) is sent.
 
 
In 2.4.5 and later, SSLProxyCheckPeerCN has been superseded by
  SSLProxyCheckPeerName  , and its
setting is only taken into account when
 SSLProxyCheckPeerName off  is specified at the same time.
