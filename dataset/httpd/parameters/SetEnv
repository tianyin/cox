SetEnv

Description:  Sets environment variables 
Syntax:   SetEnv  env-variable  [ value ]  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_env 

 Sets an internal environment variable, which is then available to Apache
    HTTP Server modules, and passed on to CGI scripts and SSI pages. 

      Example  SetEnv SPECIAL_PATH /foo/bin 
 
 
      If you omit the  value  argument, the variable is set to
    an empty string. 

      The internal environment variables set by this directive are set
     after  most early request processing directives are run, such as access
    control and URI-to-filename mapping.  If the environment variable you're
    setting is meant as input into this early phase of processing such as the
      RewriteRule   directive, you should
    instead set the environment variable with
      SetEnvIf  .
