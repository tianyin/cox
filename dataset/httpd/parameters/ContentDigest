 This directive enables the generation of
     Content-MD5  headers as defined in RFC1864
    respectively RFC2616. 

     MD5 is an algorithm for computing a "message digest"
    (sometimes called "fingerprint") of arbitrary-length data, with
    a high degree of confidence that any alterations in the data
    will be reflected in alterations in the message digest. 

     The  Content-MD5  header provides an end-to-end
    message integrity check (MIC) of the entity-body. A proxy or
    client may check this header for detecting accidental
    modification of the entity-body in transit. Example header: 

       
      Content-MD5: AuLb7Dp1rqtRtxz2m9kRpA==
       

     Note that this can cause performance problems on your server
    since the message digest is computed on every request (the
    values are not cached). 

      Content-MD5  is only sent for documents served
    by the   core  , and not by any module. For example,
    SSI documents, output from CGI scripts, and byte range responses
    do not have this header.
