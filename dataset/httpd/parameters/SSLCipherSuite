SSLCipherSuite

Description:  Cipher Suite available for negotiation in SSL
handshake 
Syntax:   SSLCipherSuite  cipher-spec   
Default:   SSLCipherSuite DEFAULT (depends on OpenSSL version)  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ssl 

 
This complex directive uses a colon-separated  cipher-spec  string
consisting of OpenSSL cipher specifications to configure the Cipher Suite the
client is permitted to negotiate in the SSL handshake phase. Notice that this
directive can be used both in per-server and per-directory context. In
per-server context it applies to the standard SSL handshake when a connection
is established. In per-directory context it forces a SSL renegotiation with the
reconfigured Cipher Suite after the HTTP request was read but before the HTTP
response is sent. 
 
An SSL cipher specification in  cipher-spec  is composed of 4 major
attributes plus a few extra minor ones: 
   Key Exchange Algorithm : 
    RSA, Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman, Secure Remote Password
 
  Authentication Algorithm : 
    RSA, Diffie-Hellman, DSS, ECDSA, or none.
 
  Cipher/Encryption Algorithm : 
    AES, DES, Triple-DES, RC4, RC2, IDEA, etc.
 
  MAC Digest Algorithm : 
    MD5, SHA or SHA1, SHA256, SHA384.
 
  An SSL cipher can also be an export cipher. SSLv2 ciphers are no longer
supported. To specify which ciphers to use, one can either specify all the
Ciphers, one at a time, or use aliases to specify the preference and order
for the ciphers (see  Table
1 ). The actually available ciphers and aliases depends on the used
openssl version. Newer openssl versions may include additional ciphers.

Now where this becomes interesting is that these can be put together
to specify the order and ciphers you wish to use. To speed this up
there are also aliases ( SSLv3, TLSv1, EXP, LOW, MEDIUM,
HIGH ) for certain groups of ciphers. These tags can be joined
together with prefixes to form the  cipher-spec . Available
prefixes are: 
  none: add cipher to list 
  + : move matching ciphers to the current location in list 
  - : remove cipher from list (can be added later again) 
  ! : kill cipher from list completely (can  not  be added later again) 
  
  aNULL ,  eNULL  and  EXP 
ciphers are always disabled 
 Beginning with version 2.4.7, null and export-grade
ciphers are always disabled, as mod_ssl unconditionally prepends any supplied
cipher suite string with  !aNULL:!eNULL:!EXP:  at initialization. 
 

 A simpler way to look at all of this is to use the `` openssl ciphers
-v '' command which provides a nice way to successively create the
correct  cipher-spec  string. The default  cipher-spec  string
depends on the version of the OpenSSL libraries used. Let's suppose it is
`` RC4-SHA:AES128-SHA:HIGH:MEDIUM:!aNULL:!MD5 '' which
means the following: Put  RC4-SHA  and  AES128-SHA  at
the beginning. We do this, because these ciphers offer a good compromise
between speed and security. Next, include high and medium security ciphers.
Finally, remove all ciphers which do not authenticate, i.e. for SSL the
Anonymous Diffie-Hellman ciphers, as well as all ciphers which use
 MD5  as hash algorithm, because it has been proven insufficient.
