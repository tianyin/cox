SetHandler

Description:  Forces all matching files to be processed by a
handler 
Syntax:   SetHandler  handler-name |None  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  FileInfo 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

 When placed into an  .htaccess  file or a
      < Directory >   or
      < Location >  
    section, this directive forces all matching files to be parsed
    through the  handler  given by
     handler-name . For example, if you had a directory you
    wanted to be parsed entirely as imagemap rule files, regardless
    of extension, you might put the following into an
     .htaccess  file in that directory: 

     SetHandler imap-file 


     Another example: if you wanted to have the server display a
    status report whenever a URL of
     http://servername/status  was called, you might put
    the following into  httpd.conf : 

     < Location "/status" >
  SetHandler server-status
< /Location > 


     You could also use this directive to configure a particular
    handler for files with a particular file extension. For example: 

     < FilesMatch \.php$ >
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
< /FilesMatch > 


     You can override an earlier defined  SetHandler 
    directive by using the value  None . 

      Note 
     Because  SetHandler  overrides default handlers,
    normal behavior such as handling of URLs ending in a slash (/) as
    directories or index files is suppressed.
