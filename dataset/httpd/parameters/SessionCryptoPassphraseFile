SessionCryptoPassphraseFile

Description:  File containing keys used to encrypt the session 
Syntax:   SessionCryptoPassphraseFile  filename   
Default:   none  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory 
Status:  Experimental 
Module:  mod_session_crypto 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache 2.3.0 and later 

 The  SessionCryptoPassphraseFile  directive specifies the
    name of a configuration file containing the keys to use for encrypting or decrypting
    the session, specified one per line. The file is read on server start, and a graceful
    restart will be necessary for httpd to pick up changes to the keys. 

     Unlike the  SessionCryptoPassphrase  directive, the keys are
    not exposed within the httpd configuration and can be hidden by protecting the file
    appropriately. 

     Multiple keys can be specified in order to support key rotation. The first key
    listed will be used for encryption, while all keys listed will be attempted for
    decryption. To rotate keys across multiple servers over a period of time, add a new
    secret to the end of the list, and once rolled out completely to all servers, remove
    the first key from the start of the list.
