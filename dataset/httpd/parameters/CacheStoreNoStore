CacheStoreNoStore

Description:  Attempt to cache requests or responses that have been marked as no-store. 
Syntax:   CacheStoreNoStore On|Off  
Default:   CacheStoreNoStore Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache 

 Ordinarily, requests or responses with Cache-Control: no-store header
       values will not be stored in the cache.  The
        CacheStoreNoStore  directive allows this
       behavior to be overridden.   CacheStoreNoStore  On
       tells the server to attempt to cache the resource even if it contains
       no-store header values.  Resources requiring authorization will
        never  be cached.

      Warning: 
       As described in RFC 2616, the no-store directive is intended to
       "prevent the inadvertent release or retention of sensitive information
       (for example, on backup tapes)."  Enabling this option could store
       sensitive information in the cache.  You are hereby warned.
