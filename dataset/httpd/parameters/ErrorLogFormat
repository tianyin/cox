ErrorLogFormat

Description:  Format specification for error log entries 
Syntax:    ErrorLogFormat [connection|request]  format   
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Core 
Module:  core 

  ErrorLogFormat  allows to specify what
    supplementary information is logged in the error log in addition to the
    actual log message. 

     #Simple example
ErrorLogFormat "[%t] [%l] [pid %P] %F: %E: [client %a] %M" 


     Specifying  connection  or  request  as first
    parameter allows to specify additional formats, causing additional
    information to be logged when the first message is logged for a specific
    connection or request, respectively. This additional information is only
    logged once per connection/request. If a connection or request is processed
    without causing any log message, the additional information is not logged
    either. 

     It can happen that some format string items do not produce output.  For
    example, the Referer header is only present if the log message is
    associated to a request and the log message happens at a time when the
    Referer header has already been read from the client.  If no output is
    produced, the default behavior is to delete everything from the preceding
    space character to the next space character.  This means the log line is
    implicitly divided into fields on non-whitespace to whitespace transitions.
    If a format string item does not produce output, the whole field is
    omitted.  For example, if the remote address  %a  in the log
    format  [%t] [%l] [%a] %M&#160;  is not available, the surrounding
    brackets are not logged either.  Space characters can be escaped with a
    backslash to prevent them from delimiting a field.  The combination '%&#160;'
    (percent space) is a zero-width field delimiter that does not produce any
    output. 

     The above behavior can be changed by adding modifiers to the format
    string item. A  -  (minus) modifier causes a minus to be logged if the
    respective item does not produce any output. In once-per-connection/request
    formats, it is also possible to use the  +  (plus) modifier. If an
    item with the plus modifier does not produce any output, the whole line is
    omitted. 

     A number as modifier can be used to assign a log severity level to a
    format item. The item will only be logged if the severity of the log
    message is not higher than the specified log severity level. The number can
    range from 1 (alert) over 4 (warn) and 7 (debug) to 15 (trace8). 

     For example, here's what would happen if you added modifiers to
    the  %{Referer}i  token, which logs the
     Referer  request header. 

       Modified Token  Meaning     %-{Referer}i  
     Logs a  -  if  Referer  is not set. 
        %+{Referer}i  
     Omits the entire line if  Referer  is not set. 
        %4{Referer}i  
     Logs the  Referer  only if the log message severity
    is higher than 4. 
       Some format string items accept additional parameters in braces. 

       Format&#160;String   Description     %%  
         The percent sign     %a  
         Client IP address and port of the request     %{c}a  
         Underlying peer IP address and port of the connection (see the
              mod_remoteip   module)     %A  
         Local IP-address and port     %{ name }e  
         Request environment variable  name      %E  
         APR/OS error status code and string     %F  
         Source file name and line number of the log call     %{ name }i  
         Request header  name      %k  
         Number of keep-alive requests on this connection     %l  
         Loglevel of the message     %L  
         Log ID of the request     %{c}L  
         Log ID of the connection     %{C}L  
         Log ID of the connection if used in connection scope, empty otherwise     %m  
         Name of the module logging the message     %M  
         The actual log message     %{ name }n  
         Request note  name      %P  
         Process ID of current process     %T  
         Thread ID of current thread     %{g}T  
         System unique thread ID of current thread (the same ID as
            displayed by e.g.  top ; currently Linux only)     %t  
         The current time     %{u}t  
         The current time including micro-seconds     %{cu}t  
         The current time in compact ISO 8601 format, including
            micro-seconds     %v  
         The canonical   ServerName  
            of the current server.     %V  
         The server name of the server serving the request according to the
              UseCanonicalName  
            setting.     \&#160;  (backslash space) 
         Non-field delimiting space     %&#160;  (percent space) 
         Field delimiter (no output)    The log ID format  %L  produces a unique id for a connection
    or request. This can be used to correlate which log lines belong to the
    same connection or request, which request happens on which connection.
    A  %L  format string is also available in
      mod_log_config  , to allow to correlate access log entries
    with error log lines. If   mod_unique_id   is loaded, its
    unique id will be used as log ID for requests. 

     #Example (default format for threaded MPMs)
ErrorLogFormat "[%{u}t] [%-m:%l] [pid %P:tid %T] %7F: %E: [client\ %a] %M%&#160;,\&#160;referer\&#160;%{Referer}i" 


     This would result in error messages such as: 

	   
    [Thu May 12 08:28:57.652118 2011] [core:error] [pid 8777:tid 4326490112] [client ::1:58619] File does not exist: /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/favicon.ico
       

     Notice that, as discussed above, some fields are omitted
    entirely because they are not defined. 

     #Example (similar to the 2.2.x format)
ErrorLogFormat "[%t] [%l] %7F: %E: [client\ %a] %M%&#160;,\&#160;referer\&#160;%{Referer}i" 


     #Advanced example with request/connection log IDs
ErrorLogFormat "[%{uc}t] [%-m:%-l] [R:%L] [C:%{C}L] %7F: %E: %M"
ErrorLogFormat request "[%{uc}t] [R:%L] Request %k on C:%{c}L pid:%P tid:%T"
ErrorLogFormat request "[%{uc}t] [R:%L] UA:'%+{User-Agent}i'"
ErrorLogFormat request "[%{uc}t] [R:%L] Referer:'%+{Referer}i'"
ErrorLogFormat connection "[%{uc}t] [C:%{c}L] local\ %a remote\ %A"
