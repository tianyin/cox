SessionMaxAge

Description:  Define a maximum age in seconds for a session 
Syntax:   SessionMaxAge  maxage   
Default:   SessionMaxAge 0  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_session 

 The  SessionMaxAge  directive defines a time limit
    for which a session will remain valid. When a session is saved, this time
    limit is reset and an existing session can be continued. If a session
    becomes older than this limit without a request to the server to refresh
    the session, the session will time out and be removed. Where a session is
    used to stored user login details, this has the effect of logging the user
    out automatically after the given time. 

     Setting the maxage to zero disables session expiry.
