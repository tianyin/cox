LDAPReferrals

Description:  Enable referral chasing during queries to the LDAP server. 
Syntax:   LDAPReferrals  On|Off|default   
Default:   LDAPReferrals On  
Context:  directory, .htaccess 
Override:  AuthConfig 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_ldap 
Compatibility:  The  default  parameter is available in Apache 2.4.7 and later 

 Some LDAP servers divide their directory among multiple domains and use referrals
    to direct a client when a domain boundary is crossed. This is similar to a HTTP redirect.
    LDAP client libraries may or may not chase referrals by default. This directive
    explicitly configures the referral chasing in the underlying SDK. 


      LDAPReferrals  takes the following values: 
      "on" 
         When set to "on", the underlying SDK's referral chasing state
              is enabled,  LDAPReferralHopLimit  is used to
              override the SDK's hop limit, and an LDAP rebind callback is
              registered.  
      "off" 
         When set to "off", the underlying SDK's referral chasing state
              is disabled completely.  
      "default" 
         When set to "default", the underlying SDK's referral chasing state
              is not changed,  LDAPReferralHopLimit  is not
              used to overide the SDK's hop limit, and no LDAP rebind callback is
              registered.  
      The directive  LDAPReferralHopLimit  works in conjunction with
    this directive to limit the number of referral hops to follow before terminating the LDAP query.
    When referral processing is enabled by a value of "On", client credentials will be provided,
    via a rebind callback, for any LDAP server requiring them.
