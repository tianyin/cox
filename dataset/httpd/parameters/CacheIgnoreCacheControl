CacheIgnoreCacheControl

Description:  Ignore request to not serve cached content to client 
Syntax:   CacheIgnoreCacheControl On|Off  
Default:   CacheIgnoreCacheControl Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache 

 Ordinarily, requests containing a Cache-Control: no-cache or
    Pragma: no-cache header value will not be served from the cache.  The
     CacheIgnoreCacheControl  directive allows this
    behavior to be overridden.   CacheIgnoreCacheControl On 
    tells the server to attempt to serve the resource from the cache even
    if the request contains no-cache header values.  Resources requiring
    authorization will  never  be cached. 

     CacheIgnoreCacheControl On 


      Warning: 
       This directive will allow serving from the cache even if the client has
       requested that the document not be served from the cache.  This might
       result in stale content being served.
