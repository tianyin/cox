CacheNegotiatedDocs

Description:  Allows content-negotiated documents to be
cached by proxy servers 
Syntax:   CacheNegotiatedDocs On|Off  
Default:   CacheNegotiatedDocs Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_negotiation 

 If set, this directive allows content-negotiated documents
    to be cached by proxy servers. This could mean that clients
    behind those proxys could retrieve versions of the documents
    that are not the best match for their abilities, but it will
    make caching more efficient. 

     This directive only applies to requests which come from
    HTTP/1.0 browsers. HTTP/1.1 provides much better control over
    the caching of negotiated documents, and this directive has no
    effect in responses to HTTP/1.1 requests.
