DirectoryCheckHandler

Description:  Toggle how this module responds when another handler is configured 
Syntax:   DirectoryCheckHandler On|Off  
Default:   DirectoryCheckHandler Off  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Override:  Indexes 
Status:  Base 
Module:  mod_dir 
Compatibility:  Available in 2.4.8 and later.  Releases prior to 2.4 implicitly
act as if "DirectoryCheckHandler ON" was specified. 

 The  DirectoryCheckHandler  directive determines 
    whether   mod_dir   should check for directory indexes or
    add trailing slashes when some other handler has been configured for
    the current URL.  Handlers can be set by directives such as 
      SetHandler   or by other modules,
    such as   mod_rewrite   during per-directory substitutions.
     

      In releases prior to 2.4, this module did not take any action if any
    other handler was configured for a URL. This allows directory indexes to 
    be served even when a  SetHandler  directive is 
    specified for an entire directory, but it can also result in some conflicts
    with modules such as  mod_rewrite .
