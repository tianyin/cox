ProxyTimeout

Description:  Network timeout for proxied requests 
Syntax:   ProxyTimeout  seconds

Module:  mod_proxy 

 This directive allows a user to specifiy a timeout on proxy requests.
    This is useful when you have a slow/buggy appserver which hangs, and you
    would rather just return a timeout and fail gracefully instead of waiting
    however long it takes the server to return.
