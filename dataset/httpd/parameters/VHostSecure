VHostSecure

Description:  Determines whether the server runs with enhanced security
for the virtualhost. 
Syntax:   VHostSecure On|Off  
Default:   VHostSecure On  
Context:  virtual host 
Status:  Experimental 
Module:  mod_privileges 
Compatibility:  Available on Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris with
non-threaded MPMs (  prefork   or custom MPM). 

 Determines whether the virtual host processes requests with
    security enhanced by removal of  Privileges  that are rarely needed in a webserver, but which are
    available by default to a normal Unix user and may therefore
    be required by modules and applications.  It is recommended that
    you retain the default (On) unless it prevents an application running.
    Since the setting applies to the  process , this is not
    compatible with threaded MPMs. 
      Note 
     If  VHostSecure  prevents an application
    running, this may be a warning sign that the application should be
    reviewed for security.
