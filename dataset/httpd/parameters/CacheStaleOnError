CacheStaleOnError

Description:  Serve stale content in place of 5xx responses. 
Syntax:   CacheStaleOnError  on|off   
Default:   CacheStaleOnError on  
Context:  server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_cache 
Compatibility:  Available in Apache 2.3.9 and later 

 When the   CacheStaleOnError   directive
  is switched on, and when stale data is available in the cache, the cache will
  respond to 5xx responses from the backend by returning the stale data instead of
  the 5xx response. While the Cache-Control headers sent by clients will be respected,
  and the raw 5xx responses returned to the client on request, the 5xx response so
  returned to the client will not invalidate the content in the cache. 

   # Serve stale data on error.
