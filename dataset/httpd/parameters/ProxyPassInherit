ProxyPassInherit

Description:  Inherit ProxyPass directives defined from the main server 
Syntax:   ProxyPassInherit On|Off  
Default:   ProxyPassInherit On  
Context:  server config, virtual host 
Status:  Extension 
Module:  mod_proxy 
Compatibility:  ProxyPassInherit is only available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.5 and later.
        and later. 

 This directive will cause the current server/vhost to "inherit"
              ProxyPass  
            directives defined in the main server. This can cause issues and
            inconsistent behavior if using the Balancer Manager for dynamic changes
            and so should be disabled if using that feature. 
         The setting in the global server defines the default for all vhosts. 
         Disabling ProxyPassInherit also disables   BalancerInherit  .
