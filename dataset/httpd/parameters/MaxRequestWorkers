MaxRequestWorkers

Description:  Maximum number of connections that will be processed
simultaneously 
Syntax:   MaxRequestWorkers  number   
Default:   See usage for details  
Context:  server config 
Status:  MPM 
Module:    event  ,   prefork  ,   worker   

 The  MaxRequestWorkers  directive sets the limit
    on the number of simultaneous requests that will be served.  Any
    connection attempts over the  MaxRequestWorkers 
    limit will normally be queued, up to a number based on the
      ListenBacklog  
    directive. Once a child process is freed at the end of a different
    request, the connection will then be serviced. 

     For non-threaded servers ( i.e. ,   prefork  ),
     MaxRequestWorkers  translates into the maximum
    number of child processes that will be launched to serve requests.
    The default value is  256 ; to increase it, you must also raise
      ServerLimit  . 

     For threaded and hybrid servers ( e.g.    event  
    or   worker  )  MaxRequestWorkers  restricts
    the total number of threads that will be available to serve clients.
    For hybrid MPMs the default value is  16  (  ServerLimit  ) multiplied by the value of
     25  (  ThreadsPerChild  ). Therefore, to increase  MaxRequestWorkers  to a value that requires more than 16 processes,
    you must also raise   ServerLimit  . 

      MaxRequestWorkers  was called
     MaxClients  before version 2.3.13. The old name is still
    supported.
