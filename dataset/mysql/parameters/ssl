ssl
The REQUIRE clause permits other             SSLrelated options, which can be used to enforce stricter             requirements than REQUIRE SSL. For             additional details about which SSL command options may or             must be specified by clients that connect using accounts             configured using the various REQUIRE             options, see the description of REQUIRE             in SectionÂ 13.7.1.4, âGRANT Syntaxâ.  The name of the SSL certificate file in PEM format to use             for establishing a secure connection. This option implies             ssl.  To verify exactly which ciphers a given server supports,             check the value of the             Ssl_cipher_list status             variable using this query:  If the MySQL distribution was built using OpenSSL or (as of             MySQL 5.6.3) yaSSL and the key file is protected by a             passphrase, the program prompts the user for the passphrase.             The password must be given interactively; it cannot be             stored in a file. If the passphrase is incorrect, the             program continues as if it could not read the key. Before             MySQL 5.6.3, if the MySQL distribution was built using yaSSL             and the key file is protected by a passphrase, an error             occurs.  Options that begin with ssl           specify whether to permit clients to connect using SSL and           indicate where to find SSL keys and certificates. See           SectionÂ 6.3.10.4, âSSL Command Optionsâ.
