max_connect_errors
If more than this many successive connection requests from a           host are interrupted without a successful connection, the           server blocks that host from further connections. You can           unblock blocked hosts by flushing the host cache. To do so,           issue a FLUSH           HOSTS statement or execute a mysqladmin           flushhosts command. If a connection is established           successfully within fewer than           max_connect_errors attempts           after a previous connection was interrupted, the error count           for the host is cleared to zero. However, once a host is           blocked, flushing the host cache is the only way to unblock           it. The default is 100 as of MySQL 5.6.6, 10 before that.
