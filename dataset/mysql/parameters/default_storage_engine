default_storage_engine
If you disable the default storage engine at server startup,           you must set the default engine for both permanent and           TEMPORARY tables to a different engine or           the server will not start.  If you disable the default storage engine at server startup,           you must set the default engine for both permanent and           TEMPORARY tables to a different engine or           the server will not start.  Disable the InnoDB storage engine. In this           case, because the default storage engine is           InnoDB, the server will not start           unless you also use           defaultstorageengine and           defaulttmpstorageengine to           set the default to some other engine for both permanent and           TEMPORARY tables.
