report_user
The value of the reportuser           option. Not the same as the name for the MySQL replication           user account.  Although the name of this option might imply otherwise,           reportuser is not connected to the MySQL           user privilege system and so is not necessarily (or even           likely to be) the same as the name of the MySQL replication           user account.  Display slave user names and passwords in the output of           SHOW SLAVE HOSTS on the master           server for slaves started with the           reportuser and           reportpassword options.
