innodb_checksums
In MySQL 5.6.3 and higher, this option is deprecated, replaced           by innodb_checksum_algorithm.           innodb_checksum_algorithm=innodb is the           same as innodb_checksums=ON (the default).           innodb_checksum_algorithm=none is the same           as innodb_checksums=OFF. Remove any           innodb_checksums options from your           configuration files and startup scripts, to avoid conflicts           with innodb_checksum_algorithm:           innodb_checksums=OFF would automatically           set innodb_checksum_algorithm=none;           innodb_checksums=ON would be ignored and           overridden by any other setting for           innodb_checksum_algorithm.
