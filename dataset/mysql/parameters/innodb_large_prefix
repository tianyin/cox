innodb_large_prefix
For tables using the           REDUNDANT           and           COMPACT           row formats, this option does not affect the allowed key           prefix length. It does introduce a new error possibility. When           this setting is enabled, attempting to create an index prefix           with a key length greater than 3072 for a           REDUNDANT or COMPACT           table causes an error           ER_INDEX_COLUMN_TOO_LONG           (1727).
