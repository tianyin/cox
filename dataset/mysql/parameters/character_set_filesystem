character_set_filesystem
The file system character set. This variable is used to           interpret string literals that refer to file names, such as in           the LOAD DATA           INFILE and           SELECT ... INTO           OUTFILE statements and the           LOAD_FILE() function. Such file           names are converted from           character_set_client to           character_set_filesystem           before the file opening attempt occurs. The default value is           binary, which means that no conversion           occurs. For systems on which multibyte file names are           permitted, a different value may be more appropriate. For           example, if the system represents file names using UTF8, set           character_set_filesystem to           'utf8'.  The file system character set. This option sets the           character_set_filesystem           system variable.
