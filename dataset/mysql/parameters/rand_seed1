The purpose of these variables is to support replication of           the RAND() function. For           statements that invoke RAND(),           the master passes two values to the slave, where they are used           to seed the random number generator. The slave uses these           values to set the session variables           rand_seed1 and           rand_seed2 so that           RAND() on the slave generates           the same value as on the master.
