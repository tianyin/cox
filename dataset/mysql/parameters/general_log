Whether the general query log is enabled. The value can be 0           (or OFF) to disable the log or 1 (or           ON) to enable the log. The default value           depends on whether the           general_log option is given.           The destination for log output is controlled by the           log_output system variable;           if that value is NONE, no log entries are           written even if the log is enabled.  Specify the initial general query log state. With no argument           or an argument of 1, the           generallog option enables           the log. If omitted or given with an argument of 0, the option           disables the log.  This option selects log output destinations, but does not           enable log output. To do that, use the           general_log and           slow_query_log options. For           FILE logging, the           general_log_file and           slow_query_log_file options determine the           log file location.
