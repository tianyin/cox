log_slave_updates
To be used on slave servers. Usually you should use the           default setting of 0, to prevent infinite loops caused by           circular replication. If set to 1, the slave does not skip           events having its own server ID. Normally, this is useful only           in rare configurations. Cannot be set to 1 if           logslaveupdates is used. By           default, the slave I/O thread does not write binary log events           to the relay log if they have the slave's server ID (this           optimization helps save disk usage). If you want to use           replicatesameserverid, be           sure to start the slave with this option before you make the           slave read its own events that you want the slave SQL thread           to execute.  Whether updates received by a slave server from a master           server should be logged to the slave's own binary log. Binary           logging must be enabled on the slave for this variable to have           any effect. See SectionÂ 16.1.4, âReplication and Binary Logging Options and Variablesâ.
