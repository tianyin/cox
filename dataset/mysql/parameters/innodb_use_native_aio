Normally, you do not need to touch this option, because it is           enabled by default. If a problem with the asynchronous I/O           subsystem in the OS prevents InnoDB from           starting, start the server with this variable disabled (use           innodb_use_native_aio=0 in           the option file). This option could also be turned off           automatically during startup, if InnoDB           detects a potential problem such as a combination of           tmpdir location, tmpfs           filesystem, and Linux kernel that that does not support AIO on           tmpfs.
