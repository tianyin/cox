Specifies that a set of           stopwords is associated           with an InnoDB FULLTEXT           index at the time the index is created. If the           innodb_ft_user_stopword_table           option is set, the stopwords are taken from that table. Else,           if the           innodb_ft_server_stopword_table           option is set, the stopwords are taken from that table.           Otherwise, a builtin set of default stopwords is used.
