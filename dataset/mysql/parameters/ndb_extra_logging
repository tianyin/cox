ndb_extra_logging
The default value is 0, which means that the only             NDBspecific information             written to the MySQL error log relates to transaction             handling. If the value is greater than 0 but less than 10,             NDB table schema and connection             events are also logged, as well as whether or not conflict             resolution is in use, and other             NDB errors and information. If             the value is set to 10 or more, information about             NDB internals, such as the             progress of data distribution among cluster nodes, is also             written to the MySQL error log.
