Number of iterations for which InnoDB keeps the previously           calculated snapshot of the flushing state, controlling how           quickly adaptive           flushing responds to changing           workloads. Increasing the           value makes the the rate of           flush operations change           smoothly and gradually as the workload changes. Decreasing the           value makes adaptive flushing adjust quickly to workload           changes, which can cause spikes in flushing activity if the           workload increases and decreases suddenly.
