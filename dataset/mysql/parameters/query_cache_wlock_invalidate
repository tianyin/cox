query_cache_wlock_invalidate
Normally, when one client acquires a WRITE           lock on a MyISAM table, other clients are           not blocked from issuing statements that read from the table           if the query results are present in the query cache. Setting           this variable to 1 causes acquisition of a           WRITE lock for a table to invalidate any           queries in the query cache that refer to the table. This           forces other clients that attempt to access the table to wait           while the lock is in effect.
