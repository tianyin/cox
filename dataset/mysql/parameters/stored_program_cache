Whenever a stored routine is executed this cache size is           checked before the first or toplevel statement in the routine           is parsed; if the number of routines of the same type (stored           procedures or stored functions according to which is being           executed) exceeds the limit specified by this variable, the           corresponding cache is flushed and memory previously allocated           for cached objects is freed. This allows the cache to be           flushed safely, even when there are dependencies between           stored routines.
