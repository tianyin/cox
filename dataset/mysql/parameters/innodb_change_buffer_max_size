Maximum size for the InnoDB           change buffer, as a           percentage of the total size of the           buffer pool. You might           increase this value for a MySQL server with heavy insert,           update, and delete activity, or decrease it for a MySQL server           with unchanging data used for reporting. For general I/O           tuning advice, see SectionÂ 8.5.7, âOptimizing InnoDB Disk I/Oâ.
