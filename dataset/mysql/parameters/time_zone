time_zone
The current time zone. This variable is used to initialize the           time zone for each client that connects. By default, the           initial value of this is 'SYSTEM' (which           means, âuse the value of           system_time_zoneâ).           The value can be specified explicitly at server startup with           the defaulttimezone option.           See SectionÂ 10.6, âMySQL Server Time Zone Supportâ.
