innodb_write_io_threads
On Linux systems, running multiple MySQL servers (typically             more than 12) with default settings for             innodb_read_io_threads,             innodb_write_io_threads, and the Linux             aiomaxnr setting can exceed system             limits. Ideally, increase the aiomaxnr             setting; as a workaround, you might reduce the settings for             one or both of the MySQL configuration options.
