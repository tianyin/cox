log_bin
Here, A serves as the master for the slave           B, and B serves as the           master for the slave C. For this to work,           B must be both a master           and a slave. You must start both           A and B with           logbin to enable binary           logging, and B with the           logslaveupdates option so           that updates received from A are logged by           B to its binary log.  Setting this option causes the           log_bin system variable to be           set to ON (or 1), and           not to the basename. Beginning with MySQL 5.6.2, the binary           log filename (with path) is available as the           log_bin_basename system           variable.  The index file for binary log file names. See           SectionÂ 5.2.4, âThe Binary Logâ. If you omit the file name, and           if you did not specify one with           logbin, MySQL uses           host_namebin.index           as the file name.  See SectionÂ 5.2.4, âThe Binary Logâ.
