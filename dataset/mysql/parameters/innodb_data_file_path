innodb_data_file_path
The paths to individual InnoDB           data files and their           sizes. The full directory path to each data file is formed by           concatenating           innodb_data_home_dir to each           path specified here. The file sizes are specified KB, MB or GB           (1024MB) by appending K,           M or G to the size           value. If specifying data file size in kilobytes (KB), do so           in multiples of 1024. Otherwise, KB values are rounded off to           nearest megabyte (MB) boundary. The sum of the sizes of the           files must be at least slightly larger than 10MB. If you do           not specify innodb_data_file_path, the           default behavior is to create a single autoextending data           file, slightly larger than 12MB, named           ibdata1. The size limit of individual           files is determined by your operating system. You can set the           file size to more than 4GB on those operating systems that           support big files. You can also           use raw disk partitions as           data files.
