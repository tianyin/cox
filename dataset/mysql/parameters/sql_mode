sql_mode
If the SQL mode differs from the default or from what you             expect, check for a setting in an option file that the             server reads at startup.  Use standard (ANSI) SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax. For           more precise control over the server SQL mode, use the           sqlmode option instead. See           SectionÂ 1.8.3, âRunning MySQL in ANSI Modeâ, and           SectionÂ 5.1.7, âServer SQL Modesâ.  If the SQL mode differs from the default or from what you             expect, check for a setting in an option file that the             server reads at startup.
