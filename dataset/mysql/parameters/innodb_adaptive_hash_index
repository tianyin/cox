innodb_adaptive_hash_index
System variables that are true or false can be enabled at           server startup by naming them, or disabled by using a           skip prefix. For example, to enable or           disable the InnoDB adaptive hash index, you           can use           innodb_adaptive_hash_index or           skipinnodb_adaptive_hash_index           on the command line, or           innodb_adaptive_hash_index or           skipinnodb_adaptive_hash_index in an           option file.  Disabling the adaptive hash index empties the hash table           immediately. Normal operations can continue while the hash           table is emptied, and executing queries that were using the           hash table access the index Btrees directly instead. When the           adaptive hash index is reenabled, the hash table is populated           again during normal operation.
