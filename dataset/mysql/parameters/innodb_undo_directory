innodb_undo_directory
The relative or absolute directory path where           InnoDB creates separate tablespaces for the           undo logs. Typically used to place those logs on a different           storage device. Used in conjunction with           innodb_undo_logs and           innodb_undo_tablespaces,           which determine the disk layout of the undo logs outside the           system           tablespace. Its default value of .           represents the same directory where InnoDB           creates its other log files by default.
