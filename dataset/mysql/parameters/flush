flush
If ON, the server flushes (synchronizes)           all changes to disk after each SQL statement. Normally, MySQL           does a write of all changes to disk only after each SQL           statement and lets the operating system handle the           synchronizing to disk. See SectionÂ C.5.4.2, âWhat to Do If MySQL Keeps Crashingâ. This           variable is set to ON if you start           mysqld with the           flush option.
