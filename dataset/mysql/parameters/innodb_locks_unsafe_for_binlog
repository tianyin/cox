innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog
For the second UPDATE,           InnoDB does a           âsemiconsistentâ read, returning the latest           committed version of each row to MySQL so that MySQL can           determine whether the row matches the WHERE           condition of the UPDATE:  Enabling               innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog               is a global setting and affects all sessions, whereas the               isolation level can be set globally for all sessions, or               individually per session.  innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog               can be set only at server startup, whereas the isolation               level can be set at startup or changed at runtime.
