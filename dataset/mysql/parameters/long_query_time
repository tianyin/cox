If a query takes longer than this many seconds, the server           increments the Slow_queries           status variable. If the slow query log is enabled, the query           is logged to the slow query log file. This value is measured           in real time, not CPU time, so a query that is under the           threshold on a lightly loaded system might be above the           threshold on a heavily loaded one. The minimum and default           values of long_query_time are           0 and 10, respectively. The value can be specified to a           resolution of microseconds. For logging to a file, times are           written including the microseconds part. For logging to           tables, only integer times are written; the microseconds part           is ignored. See SectionÂ 5.2.5, âThe Slow Query Logâ.
