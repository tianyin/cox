In MySQL 5.6.13 and later, you can control the length of time           (in seconds) that STOP SLAVE           waits before timing out by setting this variable. This can be           used to avoid deadlocks between STOP SLAVE           and other slave SQL statements using different client           connections to the slave. The maximum and default value of           rpl_stop_slave_timeout is 31536000 seconds           (1 year). The minimum is 2 seconds.
