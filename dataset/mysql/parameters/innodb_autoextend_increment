The increment size (in MB) for extending the size of an           autoextend InnoDB           system           tablespace file when it becomes full. The default value           is 64 as of MySQL 5.6.6, 8 before that. This variable does not           affect the pertable tablespace files that are created if you           use innodb_file_per_table=1.           Those files are autoextending regardless of the value of           innodb_autoextend_increment.           The initial extensions are by small amounts, after which           extensions occur in increments of 4MB.
