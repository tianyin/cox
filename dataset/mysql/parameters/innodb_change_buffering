innodb_change_buffering
Whether InnoDB performs           change buffering,           an optimization that delays write operations to secondary           indexes so that the I/O operations can be performed           sequentially. The permitted values are           inserts (buffer insert operations),           deletes (buffer delete operations; strictly           speaking, the writes that mark index records for later           deletion during a purge operation), changes           (buffer insert and deletemarking operations),           purges (buffer           purge operations, the writes           when deleted index entries are finally garbagecollected),           all (buffer insert, deletemarking, and           purge operations) and none (do not buffer           any operations). The default is all. For           details, see           SectionÂ 14.2.12.2.13, âControlling InnoDB Change Bufferingâ. For           general I/O tuning advice, see           SectionÂ 8.5.7, âOptimizing InnoDB Disk I/Oâ.
