flush_time
If this is set to a nonzero value, all tables are closed every           flush_time seconds to free up           resources and synchronize unflushed data to disk. This option           is best used only on systems with minimal resources. The           default is 0 except that before MySQL 5.6.6, the default is           1800 on Windows.
