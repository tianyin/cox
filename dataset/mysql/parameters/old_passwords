old_passwords
Passwords that use the pre4.1 hashing method are less             secure than passwords that use the native password hashing             method and should be avoided. Pre4.1 passwords are             deprecated and support for them will be removed in a future             MySQL release.  It sets the old_passwords               system variable at startup to the value that is consistent               with the password hashing method required by the default               plugin. The old_passwords               value affects hashing of passwords specified in the               IDENTIFIED BY clause of               CREATE USER and               GRANT, and passwords               specified as the argument to the               PASSWORD() function.  For an account created with either of the following               statements, the server associates the account with the               default authentication plugin and assigns the account the               given password, hashed according to the value of               old_passwords.
