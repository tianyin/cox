big_tables
If set to 1, all temporary tables are stored on disk rather           than in memory. This is a little slower, but the error           The table tbl_name is           full does not occur for           SELECT operations that require           a large temporary table. The default value for a new           connection is 0 (use inmemory temporary tables). Normally,           you should never need to set this variable, because inmemory           tables are automatically converted to diskbased tables as           required.  Enable large result sets by saving all temporary sets in           files. This option prevents most âtable fullâ           errors, but also slows down queries for which inmemory tables           would suffice. Since MySQL 3.23.2, the server is able to           handle large result sets automatically by using memory for           small temporary tables and switching to disk tables where           necessary.
