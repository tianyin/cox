innodb_undo_tablespaces
The number of           tablespace files that           the undo logs are divided           between, when you use a nonzero           innodb_undo_logs setting. By           default, all the undo logs are part of the           system           tablespace and the system tablespace will always           contain one undo tablespace in addition to those configured by           innodb_undo_tablespaces.           Because the undo logs can become large during longrunning           transactions, splitting the undo logs between multiple           tablespaces reduces the maximum size of any one tablespace.           The tablespace files are created in the location defined by           innodb_undo_directory, with           names of the form           undoN, where           N is a sequential series of           integers, including leading zeros. The default size of undo           tablespaces files is 10M. The number of           innodb_undo_tablespaces must           be set prior to initializing InnoDB.           Attempting to restart InnoDB after changing           the number of           innodb_undo_tablespaces will           result in a failed start with an error stating that InnoDB did           not find the expected number of undo tablespaces.
