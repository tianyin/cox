innodb_page_size
The default, with the largest page size, is appropriate for a           wide range of workloads,           particularly for queries involving table scans and DML           operations involving bulk updates. Smaller page sizes might be           more efficient for OLTP           workloads involving many small writes, where contention can be           an issue when a single page contains many rows. Smaller pages           might also be efficient with           SSD storage devices, which           typically use small block sizes. Keeping the           InnoDB page size close to the storage           device block size minimizes the amount of unchanged data that           is rewritten to disk. For general I/O tuning advice, see           SectionÂ 8.5.7, âOptimizing InnoDB Disk I/Oâ.
