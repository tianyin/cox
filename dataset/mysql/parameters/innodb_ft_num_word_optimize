innodb_ft_num_word_optimize
Number of words to process during each           OPTIMIZE TABLE operation on an           InnoDB FULLTEXT index.           Because a bulk insert or update operation to a table           containing a fulltext search index could require substantial           index maintenance to incorporate all changes, you might do a           series of OPTIMIZE TABLE           statements, each picking up where the last left off.
