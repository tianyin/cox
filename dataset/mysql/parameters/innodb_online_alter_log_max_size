innodb_online_alter_log_max_size
Specifies an upper limit on the size of the temporary log           files used during online           DDL operations for InnoDB tables.           There is one such log file for each index being created or           table being altered. This log file stores data inserted,           updated, or deleted in the table during the DDL operation. The           temporary log file is extended when needed by the value of           innodb_sort_buffer_size, up           to the maximum specified by           innodb_online_alter_log_max_size. If any           temporary log file exceeds the upper size limit, the           ALTER TABLE operation fails and           all uncommitted concurrent DML operations are rolled back.           Thus, a large value for this option allows more DML to happen           during an online DDL operation, but also causes a longer           period at the end of the DDL operation when the table is           locked to apply the data from the log.
