innodb_adaptive_max_sleep_delay
Allows InnoDB to automatically adjust the           value of           innodb_thread_sleep_delay up           or down according to the current workload. Any nonzero value           enables automated, dynamic adjustment of the           innodb_thread_sleep_delay value, up to the           maximum value specified in the           innodb_adaptive_max_sleep_delay option. The           value represents the number of microseconds. This option can           be useful in busy systems, with greater than 16           InnoDB threads. (In practice, it is most           valuable for MySQL systems with hundreds or thousands of           simultaneous connections.)
