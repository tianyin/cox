report_password
The value of the           reportpassword option. Not           the same as the password used for the MySQL replication user           account.  Although the name of this option might imply otherwise,           reportpassword is not connected to the           MySQL user privilege system and so is not necessarily (or even           likely to be) the same as the password for the MySQL           replication user account.
