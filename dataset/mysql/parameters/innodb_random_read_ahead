innodb_random_read_ahead
Enables the random           readahead technique           for optimizing InnoDB I/O. This is a           setting that was originally on by default, then was removed in           MySQL 5.5, and now is available but turned off by default. See           SectionÂ 14.2.12.2.16, âChanges in the ReadAhead Algorithmâ for details           about the performance considerations for the different types           of readahead requests. For general I/O tuning advice, see           SectionÂ 8.5.7, âOptimizing InnoDB Disk I/Oâ.
