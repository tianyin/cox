enforce_gtid_consistency
Obsolete: Replaced by           enforcegtidconsistency in           MySQL 5.6.9. (Bug #14775984)  In MySQL 5.6.8 and earlier, you could not use any statements           affecting nontransactional tables when           enforcegtidconsistency was used (the           option was then called           disablegtidunsafestatements).           In MySQL 5.6.9 and later, this option allows single statements           updating nontransactional tables. This is intended chiefly for           use with programs such as mysql_install_db           and mysql_upgrade. (Bug #14722659)  Prior to MySQL 5.6.9, this variable was named           disable_gtid_unsafe_statements.           (Bug #14775984)
