read_only
In MySQL 5.6, attempts to set           read_only block for active           transactions that hold metadata locks until those transactions           end.  If you attempt to enable               read_only while you have               any explicit locks (acquired with               LOCK TABLES) or have a               pending transaction, an error occurs.  If you attempt to enable               read_only while other               clients hold explicit table locks or have pending               transactions, the attempt blocks until the locks are               released and the transactions end. While the attempt to               enable read_only is               pending, requests by other clients for table locks or to               begin transactions also block until               read_only has been set.  read_only can be enabled               while you hold a global read lock (acquired with               FLUSH TABLES WITH               READ LOCK) because that does not involve table               locks.  Cause the slave to permit no updates except from slave threads           or from users having the SUPER           privilege. On a slave server, this can be useful to ensure           that the slave accepts updates only from its master server and           not from clients. This variable does not apply to           TEMPORARY tables.
