innodb_flush_neighbors
When the table data is stored on a traditional           HDD storage device, flushing           such neighbor pages           in one operation reduces I/O overhead (primarily for disk seek           operations) compared to flushing individual pages at different           times. For table data stored on           SSD, seek time is not a           significant factor and you can turn this setting off to spread           out the write operations. For general I/O tuning advice, see           SectionÂ 8.5.7, âOptimizing InnoDB Disk I/Oâ.  A setting of 0 turns               innodb_flush_neighbors off and no other               dirty pages are flushed from the buffer pool.
