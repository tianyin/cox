socket
On Windows, this variable is the name of the named pipe that           is used for local client connections. The default value is           MySQL (not case sensitive).  On Unix, this option specifies the Unix socket file to use           when listening for local connections. The default value is           /tmp/mysql.sock. If this option is given,           the server creates the file in the data directory unless an           absolute path name is given to specify a different directory.           On Windows, the option specifies the pipe name to use when           listening for local connections that use a named pipe. The           default value is MySQL (not case           sensitive).
