innodb_strict_mode
You can turn innodb_strict_mode           ON or OFF on the command           line when you start mysqld, or in the           configuration           file my.cnf or           my.ini. You can also enable or disable           innodb_strict_mode at runtime with the           statement SET [GLOBAL|SESSION]           innodb_strict_mode=mode,           where mode is           either ON or OFF.           Changing the GLOBAL setting requires the           SUPER privilege and affects the operation           of all clients that subsequently connect. Any client can           change the SESSION setting for           innodb_strict_mode, and the setting affects           only that client.
