innodb
To disable InnoDB, use           innodb=OFF           or           skipinnodb.           In this case, because the default storage engine is           InnoDB, the server will not start           unless you also use           defaultstorageengine and           defaulttmpstorageengine to           set the default to some other engine for both permanent and           TEMPORARY tables.  Disable the InnoDB storage engine. See the           description of innodb.
