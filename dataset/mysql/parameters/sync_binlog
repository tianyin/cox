sync_binlog
If binary logging is enabled, set               sync_binlog=1.  If the value of this variable is greater than 0, the MySQL           server synchronizes its binary log to disk (using           fdatasync()) after           sync_binlog commit groups are           written to the binary log. The default value of           sync_binlog is 0, which does           no synchronizing to diskâin this case, the server relies           on the operating system to flush the binary log's           contents from time to time as for any other file. A value of 1           is the safest choice because in the event of a crash you lose           at most one commit group from the binary log. However, it is           also the slowest choice (unless the disk has a batterybacked           cache, which makes synchronization very fast).
