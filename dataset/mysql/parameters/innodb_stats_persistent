innodb_stats_persistent
Specifies whether the InnoDB index           statistics produced by the ANALYZE TABLE           command are stored on disk, remaining consistent until a           subsequent ANALYZE TABLE. Otherwise, the           statistics are recalculated more frequently, such as at each           server restart, which can lead to variations in           query execution           plans. This setting is stored with each table when the           table is created. You can specify or change it through SQL           with the STATS_PERSISTENT clause of the           CREATE TABLE and           ALTER TABLE commands.
