relay_log_space_limit
The maximum amount of space to use for all relay logs.  This option places an upper limit on the total size in bytes           of all relay logs on the slave. A value of 0 means âno           limit.â This is useful for a slave server host that has           limited disk space. When the limit is reached, the I/O thread           stops reading binary log events from the master server until           the SQL thread has caught up and deleted some unused relay           logs. Note that this limit is not absolute: There are cases           where the SQL thread needs more events before it can delete           relay logs. In that case, the I/O thread exceeds the limit           until it becomes possible for the SQL thread to delete some           relay logs because not doing so would cause a deadlock. You           should not set           relaylogspacelimit to less           than twice the value of           maxrelaylogsize (or           maxbinlogsize if           maxrelaylogsize is 0). In           that case, there is a chance that the I/O thread waits for           free space because           relaylogspacelimit is           exceeded, but the SQL thread has no relay log to purge and is           unable to satisfy the I/O thread. This forces the I/O thread           to ignore           relaylogspacelimit           temporarily.
