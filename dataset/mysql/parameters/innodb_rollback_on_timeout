In MySQL 5.6, InnoDB           rolls back only the last           statement on a transaction timeout by default. If           innodb_rollback_on_timeout is           specified, a transaction timeout causes           InnoDB to abort and roll back the entire           transaction (the same behavior as in MySQL 4.1).
