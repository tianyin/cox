Shows the name used for the NDB             information database; the default is             ndbinfo. This is a readonly variable             whose value is determined at compile time; you can set it by             starting the server using             ndbinfodatabase=name,             which sets the value shown for this variable but does not             actually change the name used for the NDB information             database.
