Specifies the approximate percentage of the           InnoDB           buffer pool used for           the old block sublist. The           range of values is 5 to 95. The default value is 37 (that is,           3/8 of the pool). Often used in combination with           innodb_old_blocks_time. See           SectionÂ 14.2.12.2.24, âMaking the Buffer Pool Scan Resistantâ for           more information. See SectionÂ 8.9.1, âThe InnoDB Buffer Poolâ for           information about buffer pool management, such as the           LRU algorithm and           eviction policies.
