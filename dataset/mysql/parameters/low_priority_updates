low_priority_updates
If set to 1, all           INSERT,           UPDATE,           DELETE, and LOCK TABLE           WRITE statements wait until there is no pending           SELECT or LOCK TABLE           READ on the affected table. This affects only           storage engines that use only tablelevel locking (such as           MyISAM, MEMORY, and           MERGE).  Give tablemodifying operations           (INSERT,           REPLACE,           DELETE,           UPDATE) lower priority than           selects. This can also be done using {INSERT |           REPLACE | DELETE | UPDATE} LOW_PRIORITY ... to lower           the priority of only one query, or by SET           LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES=1 to change the priority in one           thread. This affects only storage engines that use only           tablelevel locking (MyISAM,           MEMORY, MERGE). See           SectionÂ 8.10.2, âTable Locking Issuesâ.
