ssl_capath
The path to a directory that contains trusted SSL CA           certificates in PEM format.  MySQL distributions built with OpenSSL support the             sslcapath option.             Distributions built with yaSSL do not because yaSSL does not             look in any directory and does not follow a chained             certificate tree. yaSSL requires that all components of the             CA certificate tree be contained within a single CA             certificate tree and that each certificate in the file has a             unique SubjectName value. To work around this yaSSL             limitation, concatenate the individual certificate files             comprising the certificate tree into a new file and specify             that file as the value of the             sslca option.
