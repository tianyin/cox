innodb_stats_transient_sample_pages
This option only applies when the           innodb_stats_persistent           setting is turned off for a table; when this option is turned           on for a table, the           innodb_stats_persistent_sample_pages           setting applies instead. Takes the place of the           innodb_stats_sample_pages option. See           SectionÂ 14.2.12.5, âControlling Optimizer Statistics Estimationâ for more           information.
