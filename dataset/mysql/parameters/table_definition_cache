table_definition_cache
Additionally,           table_definition_cache           defines a soft limit for the number of           InnoDB filepertable tablespaces           that can be open at one time, which is also controlled by           innodb_open_files. If both           table_definition_cache and           innodb_open_files are set,           the highest setting is used. If neither variable is set,           table_definition_cache, which           has a higher default value, is used. If the number of open           tablespace file handles exceeds the limit defined by           table_definition_cache or           innodb_open_files, the LRU           mechanism searches the tablespace file LRU list for files that           are fully flushed and are not currently being extended. This           process is performed each time a new tablespace is opened. If           there are no âinactiveâ tablespaces, no           tablespace files are closed.
