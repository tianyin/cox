max_prepared_stmt_count
This variable limits the total number of prepared statements           in the server. (The sum of the number of prepared statements           across all sessions.) It can be used in environments where           there is the potential for denialofservice attacks based on           running the server out of memory by preparing huge numbers of           statements. If the value is set lower than the current number           of prepared statements, existing statements are not affected           and can be used, but no new statements can be prepared until           the current number drops below the limit. The default value is           16,382. The permissible range of values is from 0 to 1           million. Setting the value to 0 disables prepared statements.
