This variable was removed in MySQL 5.6.1. Use           slow_query_log instead.  The logslowqueries option           was removed in MySQL 5.6.1 (along with the           log_slow_queries system           variable). Instead, use the           slow_query_log option to           enable the slow query log and the           slow_query_log_file=file_name           option to set the slow query log file name.
