If               innodb_buffer_pool_size               is greater than 1.3GB, the default for               innodb_buffer_pool_instances               is               innodb_buffer_pool_size/128MB,               with individual memory allocation requests for each chunk.               1.3GB was chosen as the boundary at which there is               significant risk for 32bit Windows to be unable to               allocate the contiguous address space needed for a single               buffer pool.  The time to initialize the buffer pool is roughly               proportional to its size. On large installations, this               initialization time might be significant. For example, on               a modern Linux x86_64 server, initialization of a 10GB               buffer pool takes approximately 6 seconds.
