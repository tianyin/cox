innodb_undo_logs
Although you can increase or decrease how many rollback           segments are used within a transaction, the number of rollback           segments physically present in the system never decreases.           Thus you might start with a low value for this parameter and           gradually increase it, to avoid allocating rollback segments           that are not needed later. If           innodb_undo_logs is not set,           it defaults to the maximum value of 128. For information about           managing rollback segments, see           SectionÂ 14.2.2.12, âInnoDB MultiVersioningâ.
