ndb_log_empty_epochs
When this variable is set to 0, epoch transactions with no             changes are not written to the binary log, although a row is             still written even for an empty epoch in             ndb_binlog_index.  Because ndblogemptyepochs=1 causes the             size of ndb_binlog_index table to             increase independently of the size of the binary log, users             should be prepared to manage the growth of this table, even             if they expect the cluster to be idle a large part of the             time.
