log_slow_slave_statements
This commandline option was removed in MySQL 5.6.11 and           replaced by the           log_slow_slave_statements           system variable. The system variable can be set on the command           line or in option files the same way as the option, so there           is no need for any changes at server startup, but the system           variable also makes it possible to examine or set the value at           runtime.  When the slow query log is enabled, this variable enables           logging for queries that have taken more than           long_query_time seconds to           execute on the slave. This variable was added in MySQL 5.6.11.
