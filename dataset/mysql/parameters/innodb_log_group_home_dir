The directory path to the InnoDB           redo log files, whose           number is specified by           innodb_log_files_in_group. If           you do not specify any InnoDB log           variables, the default is to create two files named           ib_logfile0 and           ib_logfile1 in the MySQL data directory.           Their size is given by the size of the           innodb_log_file_size system           variable.
