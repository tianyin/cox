innodb_log_buffer_size
The size in bytes of the buffer that InnoDB           uses to write to the log           files on disk. The default value is 8MB. A large           log buffer enables           large transactions to           run without a need to write the log to disk before the           transactions commit. Thus,           if you have transactions that update, insert, or delete many           rows, making the log buffer larger saves disk I/O. For general           I/O tuning advice, see           SectionÂ 8.5.7, âOptimizing InnoDB Disk I/Oâ.
