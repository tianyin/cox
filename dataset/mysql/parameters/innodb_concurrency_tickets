innodb_concurrency_tickets
Determines the number of           threads that can enter           InnoDB concurrently. A thread is placed in           a queue when it tries to enter InnoDB if           the number of threads has already reached the concurrency           limit. When a thread is permitted to enter           InnoDB, it is given a number of âfree           ticketsâ equal to the value of           innodb_concurrency_tickets,           and the thread can enter and leave InnoDB           freely until it has used up its tickets. After that point, the           thread again becomes subject to the concurrency check (and           possible queuing) the next time it tries to enter           InnoDB. The default value is 5000 as of           MySQL 5.6.6, 500 before that.
