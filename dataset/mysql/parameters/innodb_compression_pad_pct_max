innodb_compression_pad_pct_max
Specifies the maximum percentage that can be reserved as free           space within each compressed           page, allowing room to           reorganize the data and modification log within the page when           a compressed table or           index is updated and the data might be recompressed. Only           applies when           innodb_compression_failure_threshold_pct           is set to a nonzero value, and the rate of           compression           failures passes the cutoff point.
