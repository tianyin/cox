The value of the reporthost           option.  The host name or IP address of the slave to be reported to the           master during slave registration. This value appears in the           output of SHOW SLAVE HOSTS on           the master server. Leave the value unset if you do not want           the slave to register itself with the master. Note that it is           not sufficient for the master to simply read the IP address of           the slave from the TCP/IP socket after the slave connects. Due           to NAT and other routing issues, that IP may not be valid for           connecting to the slave from the master or other hosts.
