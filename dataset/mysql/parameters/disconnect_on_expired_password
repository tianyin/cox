This variable was added in MySQL 5.6.10.  If the client indicates that it can handle expires               passwords, the value of               disconnect_on_expired_password               is irrelevant. The server permits the client to connect               but puts it in sandbox mode.  If                   disconnect_on_expired_password:                   is disabled, the server permits the client to connect                   but puts it in sandbox mode.  If                   disconnect_on_expired_password:                   is enabled, the server disconnects the client.
