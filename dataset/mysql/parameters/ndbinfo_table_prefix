ndbinfo_table_prefix
The prefix used in naming the ndbinfo database's base             tables (normally hidden, unless exposed by setting             ndbinfo_show_hidden). This             is a readonly variable whose default value is             ândb$â. You can start the             server with the ndbinfotableprefix             option, but this merely sets the variable and does not             change the actual prefix used to name the hidden base             tables; the prefix itself is determined at compile time.
