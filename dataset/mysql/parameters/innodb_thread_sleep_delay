How long InnoDB threads sleep before           joining the InnoDB queue, in microseconds.           The default value is 10,000. A value of 0 disables sleep. In           MySQL 5.6.3 and higher, you can set the configuration option           innodb_adaptive_max_sleep_delay           to the highest value you would allow for           innodb_thread_sleep_delay, and InnoDB           automatically adjusts           innodb_thread_sleep_delay up or down           depending on the current threadscheduling activity. This           dynamic adjustment helps the thread scheduling mechanism to           work smoothly during times when the system is lightly loaded           and when it is operating near full capacity.
