binlog_checksum
This option was added in MySQL 5.6.2.  In MySQL 5.6.6 and later, setting this variable on the master           to a value unrecognized by the slave causes the slave to set           its own binlog_checksum value to           NONE, and to stop replication with an           error. (Bug #13553750, Bug #61096) If backward compatibility           with older slaves is a concern, you may want to set the value           explicitly to NONE.
