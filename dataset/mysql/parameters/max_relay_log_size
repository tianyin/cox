max_relay_log_size
If a write by a replication slave to its relay log causes the           current log file size to exceed the value of this variable,           the slave rotates the relay logs (closes the current file and           opens the next one). If           max_relay_log_size is 0, the           server uses max_binlog_size           for both the binary log and the relay log. If           max_relay_log_size is greater           than 0, it constrains the size of the relay log, which enables           you to have different sizes for the two logs. You must set           max_relay_log_size to between           4096 bytes and 1GB (inclusive), or to 0. The default value is           0. See SectionÂ 16.2.1, âReplication Implementation Detailsâ.  The size at which the server rotates relay log files           automatically. For more information, see           SectionÂ 16.2.2, âReplication Relay and Status Logsâ. The default size is 1GB.  If you need to put the relay logs in some area other than               the data directory because your relay logs tend to be very               large and you do not want to decrease               max_relay_log_size.
