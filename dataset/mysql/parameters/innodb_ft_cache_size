The memory allocated for the InnoDB           FULLTEXT search index cache, which holds a parsed document in           memory while creating an InnoDB           FULLTEXT index. Index inserts and updates           are only committed to disk when the           innodb_ft_cache_size size limit is reached.           innodb_ft_cache_size defines the cache size           on a per table basis. To set a global limit for all tables,           see           innodb_ft_total_cache_size.
