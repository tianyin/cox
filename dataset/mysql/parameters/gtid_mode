gtid_mode
Prior to MySQL 5.6.10, setting the global value for the           sql_slave_skip_counter           variable to 1 had no effect when gtidmode           was set to ON. (Bug #15833516) A workaround           in MySQL 5.6.9 and earlier versions is to reset the           slave's position using           CHANGE           MASTER TO ... MASTER_LOG_FILE = ... MASTER_LOG_POS =           ..., including the MASTER_AUTO_POSITION =           0 option with this statement if needed.  Shows whether GTIDs are enabled. Readonly; set using           gtidmode.
