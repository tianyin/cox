skip_show_database
This prevents people from using the SHOW           DATABASES statement if they do not have the           SHOW DATABASES privilege. This           can improve security if you have concerns about users being           able to see databases belonging to other users. Its effect           depends on the SHOW DATABASES           privilege: If the variable value is ON, the           SHOW DATABASES statement is           permitted only to users who have the SHOW           DATABASES privilege, and the statement displays all           database names. If the value is OFF,           SHOW DATABASES is permitted to           all users, but displays the names of only those databases for           which the user has the SHOW           DATABASES or other privilege. (Note that           any global privilege is considered a           privilege for the database.)  This option sets the           skip_show_database system           variable that controls who is permitted to use the           SHOW DATABASES statement. See           SectionÂ 5.1.4, âServer System Variablesâ.
