RPC address for HDFS Services communication. BackupNode, Datanodes and all other services should be
    connecting to this address if it is configured. In the case of HA/Federation where multiple namenodes exist,
    the name service id is added to the name e.g. dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address.ns1
    dfs.namenode.rpc-address.EXAMPLENAMESERVICE
    The value of this property will take the form of nn-host1:rpc-port.
    If the value of this property is unset the value of dfs.namenode.rpc-address will be used as the default.
