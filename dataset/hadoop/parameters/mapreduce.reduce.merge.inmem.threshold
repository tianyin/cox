The threshold, in terms of the number of files 
  for the in-memory merge process. When we accumulate threshold number of files
  we initiate the in-memory merge and spill to disk. A value of 0 or less than
  0 indicates we want to DON'T have any threshold and instead depend only on
  the ramfs's memory consumption to trigger the merge.
