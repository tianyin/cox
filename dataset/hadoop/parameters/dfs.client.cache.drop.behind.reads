dfs client cache drop behind reads
Just like dfs.datanode.drop.cache.behind.reads, this setting causes the
    page cache to be dropped behind HDFS reads, potentially freeing up more
    memory for other uses.  Unlike dfs.datanode.drop.cache.behind.reads, this
    is a client-side setting rather than a setting for the entire datanode.  If
    present, this setting will override the DataNode default.

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
    configuration has no effect.
