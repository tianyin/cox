mapreduce task skip start attempts
2
The number of Task attempts AFTER which skip mode 
    will be kicked off. When skip mode is kicked off, the 
    tasks reports the range of records which it will process 
    next, to the TaskTracker. So that on failures, TT knows which 
    ones are possibly the bad records. On further executions, 
    those are skipped.
