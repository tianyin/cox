dfs client write exclude nodes cache expiry interval millis
600000
The maximum period to keep a DN in the excluded nodes list
  at a client. After this period, in milliseconds, the previously excluded node(s) will
  be removed automatically from the cache and will be considered good for block allocations
  again. Useful to lower or raise in situations where you keep a file open for very long
  periods (such as a Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) file) to make the writer tolerant to cluster maintenance
  restarts. Defaults to 10 minutes.
