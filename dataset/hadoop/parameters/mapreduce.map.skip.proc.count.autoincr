true
The flag which if set to true, 
    SkipBadRecords.COUNTER_MAP_PROCESSED_RECORDS is incremented 
    by MapRunner after invoking the map function. This value must be set to 
    false for applications which process the records asynchronously 
    or buffer the input records. For example streaming. 
    In such cases applications should increment this counter on their own.
