dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis
500
Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the base value used in the failover calculation. The
    first failover will retry immediately. The 2nd failover attempt
    will delay at least dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis
    milliseconds. And so on.
