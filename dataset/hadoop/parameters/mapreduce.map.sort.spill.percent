mapreduce.map.sort.spill.percent
0.80
The soft limit in the serialization buffer. Once reached, a
  thread will begin to spill the contents to disk in the background. Note that
  collection will not block if this threshold is exceeded while a spill is
  already in progress, so spills may be larger than this threshold when it is
  set to less than .5
