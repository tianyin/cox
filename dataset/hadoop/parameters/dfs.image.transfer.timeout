600000
Timeout for image transfer in milliseconds. This timeout and the related
        dfs.image.transfer.bandwidthPerSec parameter should be configured such
        that normal image transfer can complete within the timeout.
        This timeout prevents client hangs when the sender fails during
        image transfer, which is particularly important during checkpointing.
        Note that this timeout applies to the entirety of image transfer, and
        is not a socket timeout.
