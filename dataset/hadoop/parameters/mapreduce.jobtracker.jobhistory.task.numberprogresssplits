mapreduce jobtracker jobhistory task numberprogresssplits
12
Every task attempt progresses from 0.0 to 1.0 [unless
  it fails or is killed].  We record, for each task attempt, certain 
  statistics over each twelfth of the progress range.  You can change
  the number of intervals we divide the entire range of progress into
  by setting this property.  Higher values give more precision to the
  recorded data, but costs more memory in the job tracker at runtime.
  Each increment in this attribute costs 16 bytes per running task.
