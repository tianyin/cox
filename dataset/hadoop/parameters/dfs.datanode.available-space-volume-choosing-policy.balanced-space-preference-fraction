dfs datanode available-space-volume-choosing-policy balanced-space-preference-fraction
0.75f
Only used when the dfs.datanode.fsdataset.volume.choosing.policy is set to
    org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.AvailableSpaceVolumeChoosingPolicy.
    This setting controls what percentage of new block allocations will be sent
    to volumes with more available disk space than others. This setting should
    be in the range 0.0 - 1.0, though in practice 0.5 - 1.0, since there should
    be no reason to prefer that volumes with less available disk space receive
    more block allocations.
