dfs namenode servicerpc-bind-host
The actual address the server will bind to. If this optional address is
    set, the service RPC server will bind to this address and the port 
    specified in dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address. It can also be specified
    per name node or name service for HA/Federation. This is most useful for
    making name node listen to all interfaces by setting to 0.0.0.0.
