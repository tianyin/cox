dfs client local interfaces
A comma separated list of network interface names to use
    for data transfer between the client and datanodes. When creating
    a connection to read from or write to a datanode, the client
    chooses one of the specified interfaces at random and binds its
    socket to the IP of that interface. Individual names may be
    specified as either an interface name (eg "eth0"), a subinterface
    name (eg "eth0:0"), or an IP address (which may be specified using
    CIDR notation to match a range of IPs).
