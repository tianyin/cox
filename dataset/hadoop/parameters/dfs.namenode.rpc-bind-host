dfs.namenode.rpc-bind-host
The actual address the server will bind to. If this optional address is
    set, the RPC server will bind to this address and the port specified in
    dfs.namenode.rpc-address for the RPC server. It can also be specified
    per name node or name service for HA/Federation. This is most useful for
    making name node listen to all interfaces by setting to 0.0.0.0.
