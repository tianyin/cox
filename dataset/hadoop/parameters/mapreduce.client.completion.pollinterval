mapreduce client completion pollinterval
5000
The interval (in milliseconds) between which the JobClient
    polls the JobTracker for updates about job status. You may want to set this
    to a lower value to make tests run faster on a single node system. Adjusting
    this value in production may lead to unwanted client-server traffic.
