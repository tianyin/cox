false
Specifies whether to flush edit log file channel. When set, expensive
    FileChannel#force calls are skipped and synchronous disk writes are
    enabled instead by opening the edit log file with RandomAccessFile("rws")
    flags. This can significantly improve the performance of edit log writes
    on the Windows platform.
    Note that the behavior of the "rws" flags is platform and hardware specific
    and might not provide the same level of guarantees as FileChannel#force.
    For example, the write will skip the disk-cache on SAS and SCSI devices
    while it might not on SATA devices. This is an expert level setting,
    change with caution.
