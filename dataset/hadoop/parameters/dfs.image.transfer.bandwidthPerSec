0
Maximum bandwidth used for image transfer in bytes per second.
        This can help keep normal namenode operations responsive during
        checkpointing. The maximum bandwidth and timeout in
        dfs.image.transfer.timeout should be set such that normal image
        transfers can complete successfully.
        A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled.
