dfs namenode audit loggers
default
List of classes implementing audit loggers that will receive audit events.
    These should be implementations of org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.AuditLogger.
    The special value "default" can be used to reference the default audit
    logger, which uses the configured log system. Installing custom audit loggers
    may affect the performance and stability of the NameNode. Refer to the custom
    logger's documentation for more details.
