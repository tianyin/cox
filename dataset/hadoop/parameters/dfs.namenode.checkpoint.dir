dfs namenode checkpoint dir
file://${hadoop.tmp.dir}/dfs/namesecondary
Determines where on the local filesystem the DFS secondary
      name node should store the temporary images to merge.
      If this is a comma-delimited list of directories then the image is
      replicated in all of the directories for redundancy.
