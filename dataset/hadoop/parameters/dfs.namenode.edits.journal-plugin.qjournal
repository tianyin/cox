dfs namenode edits journal-plugin qjournal
org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.qjournal.client.QuorumJournalManager
A directory on shared storage between the multiple namenodes
  in an HA cluster. This directory will be written by the active and read
  by the standby in order to keep the namespaces synchronized. This directory
  does not need to be listed in dfs.namenode.edits.dir above. It should be
  left empty in a non-HA cluster.
