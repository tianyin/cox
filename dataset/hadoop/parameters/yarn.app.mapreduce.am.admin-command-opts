yarn app mapreduce am admin-command-opts

  It will appears before the opts set by yarn.app.mapreduce.am.command-opts and
  thus its options can be overridden user. 
  
  Usage of -Djava.library.path can cause programs to no longer function if
  hadoop native libraries are used. These values should instead be set as part 
  of LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the map / reduce JVM env using the mapreduce.map.env and 
  mapreduce.reduce.env config settings.
